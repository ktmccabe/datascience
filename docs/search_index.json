"],["what-have-i-signed-up-for.html", "1.1 What have I signed up for?", " 1.1 What have I signed up for? First: What is Data Science? Data Science involves a combination of math/statistics and programming/coding skills, which, for our purposes, we will combine with social science knowledge. Drew Conway has a nice venn diagram of how these different skill sets intersect. Note: This course will not assume prior familiarity with data science in general or coding, specifically. For those brand new to data science, the idea of learning to code may seem intimidating, but anyone can succeed with a bit of patience and an open mind. Next: What is political science? The science of politics, of course! Politics focuses on studying governance and the distribution of power in society, broadly conceived. How else might you define politics and political science? What do we study in political science? 1.1.1 Data Science Can Help Social Scientists Example: Mapping poverty using mobile phone and satellite data Researchers used modern data sources, including mobile phone data, as a way to predict and describe poverty in different geographic regions. These tools helped social scientists come up with methods that are much more cost-effective and efficient, but still as accurate as traditional methods for this type of measurement. How might measures of global poverty be useful to political scientists? Steele et al. 2017: Poverty is one of the most important determinants of adverse health outcomes globally, a major cause of societal instability and one of the largest causes of lost human potential. Traditional approaches to measuring and targeting poverty rely heavily on census data, which in most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are unavailable or out-of-date. Alternate measures are needed to complement and update estimates between censuses. This study demonstrates how public and private data sources that are commonly available for LMICs can be used to provide novel insight into the spatial distribution of poverty. Social Science Goals We have several goals in social science. Here are four that data science can help us pursue: Describe and measure Has the U.S. population increased? Explain, evaluate, and recommend (study of causation) Does expanding Medicaid improve health outcomes? Predict Who will win the next election? Discover How do policies diffuse across states? What are other examples of these goals? Note: In this course, we are exploiting the benefits of quantitative data to help achieve goals of social science. However, quantitative data have their shortcomings, too. We will also discuss the limitations of various applications of social science data, and we encourage you to always think critically about how we are using data. 1.1.2 Course Goals This course will provide you with a taste of each of these social science goals, and how the use of data can help achieve these goals. By the end of the course, you should be able to Provide examples of how quantitative data may be used to help answer social science research questions. Compare and contrast the goals of description, causation, prediction, and discovery in social science research. Use the programming language R to import and explore social science data and conduct basic statistical analyses. Interpret and describe visual displays of social science data, such as graphs and maps. Develop your own analyses and visualizations to understand social science phenomena. If you are someone that loves data, we hope you will find this course engaging. If you are someone who loathes or finds the idea of working with data and statistics alarming, we hope you keep an open mind. We will meet you where you are. This course will not assume knowledge of statistical software, and there will be plenty of opportunities to ask questions and seek help from classmates and the instructor throughout the semester. The first section of course will walk people through how to use the statistical program– R– that we will employ this semester. Will this course help me in the future? Even if you do not plan on becoming a social scientist or a data scientist, an introduction to these skills may prove helpful throughout your academic and professional careers. To become an informed consumer of news articles and research involving quantitative analyses. To practice analytical thinking to make informed arguments and decisions. To expand your toolkit for getting a job that may involve consuming or performing some data analysis, even if that is not the traditional role. Example: Journalism- How 5 Data Dynamos Do Their Jobs "],["rsetup.html", "1.2 Setup in R", " 1.2 Setup in R Goal By the end of the first week of the course, you will want to have R and RStudio installed on your computer (both free) and feel comfortable using R as a calculator. R is an application that processes the R programming language in a statistical computing environment. RStudio is also an application, which serves as a user interface that makes working in R easier. We will primarily open and use RStudio to work with R. In other classes, you may come across Stata, SPSS, Excel, or SAS, which are programs that also conduct data analysis. R has the advantage of being free and open-source. Even after you leave the university setting, you will be able to use R/RStudio for free. As an open-source program, it is very flexible, and a community of active R/RStudio users is constantly adding to and improving the program. R and RStudio Installation This content follows and reinforces QSS 1.3. Additional resources are also linked below. This video from Professor Christopher Bail explains why many social scientists use R and describes the R and RStudio installation process. This involves Going to cran, select the link that matches your operating system, and then follow the installation instructions, and Visiting RStudio and follow the download and installation instructions. R is the statistical software and programming language used for analysis. RStudio provides a convenient user interface for running R code. "],["first-time-working-in-r-and-rstudio.html", "1.3 First Time Working in R and RStudio", " 1.3 First Time Working in R and RStudio This next section provides a few notes on using R and RStudio now that you have installed it. In this section, we cover the following materials: Using R as a calculator and assigning objects using &lt;- Setting your working directory and the setwd() function. Creating and saving an R script This section highlights important concepts from QSS chapter 1. 1.3.1 Open RStudio RStudio is an open-source and free program that greatly facilitates the use of R, especially for users new to programming. Once you have downloaded and installed R and RStudio, to work in R, all you need to do now is open RStudio (it will open R). It should look like this, though your version numbers will be different: Note: The first time you open RStudio, you likely only have the three windows above. We will want to create a fourth window by opening an R script to create the fourth window. To do this, in RStudio, click on File -&gt; New -&gt; R script in your computer’s toolbar. This will open a blank document for text editing in the upper left of the RStudio window. We will return to this window in a moment. You can alternatively click on the green + sign indicator in the top-left corner of the RStudio window, which should give you the option to create a new R script document. Now you should have something that looks like this, similar to Figure 1.1. in QSS: The upper-left window has our script document that will contain code. The lower-left window is the console. This will show the output of the code we run. We will also be able to type directly in the console. The upper-right window shows the environment (and other tabs, such as the history of commands). When we load and store data in RStudio, we will see a summary of that in the environment. The lower-right window will enable us to view plots and search help files, among other things. 1.3.2 Using R as a Calculator The bottom left window in your RStudio is the Console. You can type in this window to use R as a calculator or to try out commands. It will show the raw output of any commands you type. For example, we can try to use R as a calculator. Type the following in the Console (the bottom left window) and hit “enter” or “return” on your keyboard: 5 + 3 ## [1] 8 5 - 3 ## [1] 2 5^2 ## [1] 25 5 * 3 ## [1] 15 5/3 ## [1] 1.666667 (5 + 3) * 2 ## [1] 16 In the other RStudio windows, the upper right will show a history of commands that you have sent from the text editor to the R console, along with other items. The lower right will show graphs, help documents and other features. These will be useful later in the course. 1.3.3 Working in an R Script Earlier, I asked you to open an R script in the upper left window by doing File, then New File, then R Script. Let’s go back to working in that window. Set your working directory setwd() (Almost) every time you work in RStudio, the first thing you will do is set your working directory. This is a designated folder in your computer where you will save your R scripts and datasets. There are many ways to do this. An easy way is to go to Session -&gt; Set Working Directory -&gt; Choose Directory. I suggest choosing a folder in your computer that you can easily find and that you will routinely use for this class. Go ahead and create/select it. Note: when you selected your directory, code came out in the bottom left Console window. This is the setwd() command which can also be used directly to set your working directory in the future. If you aren’t sure where your directory has been set, you can also type getwd() in your Console. Try it now ## Example of where my directory was getwd() If I want to change the working directory, I can go to the top toolbar of my computer and use Session -&gt; Set Working Directory -&gt; Choose Directory or just type my file pathway using the setwd() below: ## Example of setting the working directory using setwd(). ## Your computer will have your own file path. setwd(&quot;/Users/ktmccabe/Dropbox/Rutgers Teaching/&quot;) Saving the R Script Let’s now save our R script to our working directory and give it an informative name. To do so, go to File, then Save As, make sure you are in the same folder on your computer as the folder you chose for your working directory. Give the file an informative name, such as: “McCabeWeek1.R”. Note: all of your R scripts will have the .R extension. 1.3.4 Preparing your R script Now that we have saved our R script, let’s work inside of it. Remember, we are in the top-left RStudio window now. Just like the beginning of a paper, you will want to title your R script. In R, any line that you start with a # will not be treated as a programming command. You can use this to your advantage to write titles/comments. Below is a screenshot example of a template R script. You can specify your working directory at the top, too. Add your own filepath inside setwd() Then you can start answering problems in the rest of the script. Think of the R script as where you write the final draft of your paper. In the Console (the bottom-left window), you can mess around and try different things, like you might when you are taking notes or outlining an essay. Then, write the final programming steps that lead you to your answer in the R script. For example, if I wanted to add 5 + 3, I might try different ways of typing it in the Console, and then when I found out 5 + 3 is the right approach, I would type that into my script. 1.3.5 Executing Commands in your R script The last thing we will note in this initial handout is how to execute commands in your R script. To run / execute a command in your R script (the upper left window), you can Highlight the code you want to run, and then hold down “command + return” on a Mac or “control + enter” on Windows Place your cursor at the end of the line of code (far right), and hit “command + return” on a Mac or “control + return” on Windows, or Do 1 or 2, but instead of using the keyboard to execute the commands, click “Run” in the top right corner of the upper-left window. Try it: Type 5 + 3 in the R script. Then, try to execute 5 + 3. It should look something like this: After you executed the code, you should see it pop out in your Console: 5 + 3 ## [1] 8 Note: The symbol # also allows for annotation behind commands or on a separate line. Everything that follows # will be ignored by R. You can annotate your own code so that you and others can understand what each part of the code is designed to do. ## Example sum53 &lt;- 5 + 3 # example of assigning an addition calculation 1.3.6 Objects Sometimes we will want to store our calculations as “objects” in R. We use &lt;- to assign objects by placing it to the left of what we want to store. For example, let’s store the calculation 5 + 3 as an object named sum53: sum53 &lt;- 5 + 3 After we execute this code, sum53 now stores the calculation. This means, that if we execute a line of code that just hassum53`, it will output 8. Try it: sum53 ## [1] 8 Now we no longer have to type 5 + 3, we can just type sum53. For example, let’s say we wanted to subtract 2 from this calculation. We could do: sum53 - 2 ## [1] 6 Let’s say we wanted to divide two stored calculations: ten &lt;- 5 + 5 two &lt;- 1 + 1 ten / two ## [1] 5 The information stored does not have to be numeric. For example, it can be a word, or what we would call a character string, in which case you need to use quotation marks. mccabe &lt;- &quot;professor for this course&quot; mccabe ## [1] &quot;professor for this course&quot; Note: Object names cannot begin with numbers and no spacing is allowed. Avoid using special characters such as % and $, which have specific meanings in R. Finally, use concise and intuitive object names. GOOD CODE: practice.calc &lt;- 5 + 3 BAD CODE: meaningless.and.unnecessarily.long.name &lt;- 5 + 3 While these are simple examples, we will use objects all the time for more complicated things to store (e.g., like full datasets!) throughout the course. We can also store an array or “vector” of information using c() somenumbers &lt;- c(3, 6, 8, 9) somenumbers ## [1] 3 6 8 9 Importance of Clean Code Ideally, when you are done with your R script, you should be able to highlight the entire script and execute it without generating any error messages. This means your code is clean. Code with typos in it may generate a red error message in the Console upon execution. This can happen when there are typos or commands are misused. For example, R is case sensitive. Let’s say we assigned our object like before: sum53 &lt;- 5 + 3 However, when we went to execute sum53, we accidentally typed Sum53: Sum53 ## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object &#39;Sum53&#39; not found Only certain types of objects can be used in mathematical calculations. Let’s say we tried to divide mccabe by 2: mccabe / 2 ## Error in mccabe/2: non-numeric argument to binary operator A big part of learning to use R will be learning how to troubleshoot and detect typos in your code that generate error messages. "],["assignment-1.html", "1.4 Assignment 1", " 1.4 Assignment 1 Below is an exercise that will demonstrate you are able to use R as a calculator and create R scripts, as well as locate important course platforms. We will walk through this assignment together during class, but you are welcome to try to do this ahead of time on your own. You will submit, on Canvas, two documents prior to the deadline. An R script (.R) file with your code. Follow the best practices by titling your script and using # comments to explain your steps. This code should be clean. I should be able to run your code to verify that the code produces the answers you write down. A Word document / Google Docs document or pdf with answers to the written questions (Problems 3-6 below). This document should also have a title with your name on it. You may also alternatively submit a compiled RMarkdown document. We will discuss what RMarkdown is during class. Assignment Exercises Create an R script saved as ``LastnameSetup1.R” (use your last name). Within the R script, follow the example from this handout and title the script. Set your working directory, and include the file pathway (within setwd()) at the top of your .R script. Do the calculation 8 + 3 - 2 in R. Store it as an object with an informative name. Report the answer. Do the calculation 5 x 3 in R. Store it as an object with an informative name. Report the answer. Add these two calculations together. Note: do this by adding together the objects you created, not the underlying raw calculations. Report the answer. Write down how you will complete your R assignments this semester. For example, if you have a personal laptop with R and RStudio on it, you will simply write “I will use my personal laptop.” If you don’t have a personal computer or laptop, please indicate where on campus or off-campus you will have regular access to a computer with R/RStudio to do your work. It is essential that you have regular access to a computer so that you will not fall behind in this course. Navigate to the course Piazza site and post a message. This can be as simple as “hello” or a reply to another person’s post. (No need to report this in your submission.) "],["r-markdown.html", "1.5 R Markdown", " 1.5 R Markdown An R Markdown document, which you can create in RStudio, allows you to weave together regular text, R code, and the output of R code in the same document. This can be very convenient when conducting data analysis because it allows you more space to explain what you are doing in each step. It can also be an effective platform for writing a report on a data analysis, similar to what you do when you write up a problem set. Note: RMarkdown is not required for this course. It is up to you if you would like to write your problem sets in RMarkdown R Markdown documents can be “compiled” into html, pdf, or docx documents. Below is an example of what a compiled html file looks like. Note that the image has both written text and a gray chunk, within which there is some R code, as well as the output of the R code (e.g., the number 8 and the image of the histogram plot) We say this is a “compiled” RMarkdown document because it differs from the raw version of the file, which is a .Rmd file format. Below is an example of what the raw .Rmd version looks like, compared to the compiled html version. 1.5.1 How to get setup in RMarkdown Just like with a regular R script, to work in RMarkdown, you will open up RStudio. The first time you will be working in RMarkdown, you will want to install two packages: rmarkdown and knitr. You can do this in the Console window in RStudio. Type the following into the Console window and hit enter/return. install.packages(&quot;rmarkdown&quot;) install.packages(&quot;knitr&quot;) Once you have those installed, now, each time you want to create an RMarkdown document, you will open up a .Rmd R Markdown file and get to work. Go to File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Markdown in RStudio Alternatively, you can click the green + symbol at the top left of your RStudio window This should open up a window with several options, similar to the image below Create an informative title and change the author name to match your own For now, we will keep the file type as html. In the future, you can create pdf or .doc documents. However, these require additional programs installed on your computer. After you hit “OK” a new .Rmd script file will open in your top-left window with some template language and code chunks, similar to the image below. Save as .Rmd file. Save the file by going to “File -&gt; Save as” in RStudio Give the file an informative name like your LastnamePractice1.Rmd Key Components. Now you are ready to work within the Rmd script file. We will point to four basic components of this file, and you can build your knowledge of RMarkdown from there. The top part bracketed by --- on top and bottom is the YAML component. This tells RStudio the pertinent information about how to “compile” the Rmd file. Most of the time you can leave this alone, but you can always edit the title, author, or date as you wish. The next component are the global options for the document. It is conveniently labeled “setup.” By default what this is saying is that the compiled version will “echo” (i.e., display all code chunks and output) unless you specifically specify otherwise. For example, note that it says include = FALSE for the setup chunk. That setting means that this code chunk will “run” but it will not appear in the nicely compiled .html file. Most of the time you will not need to edit those settings. The third component I want to bring attention to is the body text. The # symbol in RMarkdown is used to indicate that you have a new section of the document. For example, in the compiled images at the beginning, this resulted in the text being larger and bolded when it said “Problem 2.” In addition to just using a single #, using ## or ### can indicate subsections or subsubsections. Other than that symbol, you can generally write text just as you would in any word processing program, with some exceptions, such as how to make text bold or italicized. (See bottom of section for resources on the Markdown language.) The final component I want to call attention to are the other main body code chunks. These are specific parts of the document where you want to create a mini R script. To create these, you can simply click the + C symbol toward the top of the top left window of RStudio and indicate you want an R chunk. For example, in the image above, there is an R code chunk labeled cars. The cars component is just a label for the code chunk. Labeling code chunks is not necessary. By default, a new R code chunk will just have r in the brackets, and that is sufficient. Writing R Code. Within a code chunk, you can type R code just like you would in any R script. To run (“execute”) the R code, you can run a single line the exact same way you do in a regular R script by moving the cursor to the end of a line of code or highlighting a portion of code and hitting “Run.” However, in RMarkdown, you also have the option of running an entire code chunk at once by hitting the green triangle at the top-right of a given code chunk. Knitting the document. Once you have added a code chunk and/or some text, you are ready to compile or “Knit” the document. This is what generates the .html document. To do so, click on the Knit button toward the top of the top-left window of Rstudio. After a few moments, this should open up a preview window displaying the compiled html file. It will also save an actual .html file in your working directory (the same location on your computer where you have saved the .Rmd file) Try to locate this compiled .html file on your computer and open it. For most computers, .html files will open in your default web browser, such as Google Chrome or Safari. This step is a common place where errors are detected and generated. Sometimes the compiling process fails due to errors in the R code in your code chunks or an error in the Markdown syntax. If your document fails to knit, the next step is to try to troubleshoot the error messages the compiling process generates. The best way to reduce and more easily detect errors is to “knit as you go.” Try to knit your document after each chunk of code you create. 1.5.2 Additional RMarkdown resources Here are a few additional resources for working with RMarkdown. This website provides some basic syntax for the Markdown language, such as how to display bulleted lists and how to bold or italicize text. This page walks through the setup of RMarkdown documents similar to what the course notes just did. This provides a second set of instructions and additional examples of settings you can use to customize your RMarkdown output (e.g., how large figures are when they are displayed). This page talks more about compiling aka rendering aka knitting Rmd documents into different formats, such as html, pdf, or Word doc files. See the course Canvas page for additional templates for working with RMarkdown in problem sets. "],["wait-a-second-why-r.html", "1.6 Wait a second why R?", " 1.6 Wait a second why R? R is a free and open-source program. This means anyone can use R. In the future, if you are not at a university that provides licenses for software or at an organization that can afford to buy very expensive softwares (e.g., SPSS, Stata), you can still use R!! This means anyone can access the underlying code to understand how different functions and capabilities work. R has a very large community of users and developers. People are constantly expanding R’s capabilities. This means that as the tools and methods change, R will also adapt very quickly to expand with new capabilities. Google will be your friend. Multiple websites are devoted to helping people troubleshoot R problems and providing tutorials for using R. R is very versatile R can Manage multiple datasets at once, subset, append, and merge data Be used for descriptive analyses, as well more complicated statistical methods, Employ APIs to communicate with external databases, Map data, Conduct text analyses, And create interactive visualizations, among other capabilities. With RStudio, users can also directly integrate their R code and written text to automatically generate data reports, presentations, interactive dashboards, and more. R also has a reputation of having terrific visualization tools, again with a lot of flexibility R facilitates reproducibility (While some other softwares also provide this ability), R encourages the use of scripts, which help researchers keep track of every modification they have made to data and every analysis they have run. This helps future researchers replicate, verify, and build on previous research. Imagine if you accidentally enter the wrong number in a spreadsheet cell in Excel/google sheets. You may have no record you ever did that. In R, you can track all of the modifications you make so that months later you can review your steps to check them for accuracy. R is popular While there is no guarantee R will remain popular forever, it is commonly employed in many different industries and organizations. Learning R can be a useful skill when applying for jobs. Moreover, even if jobs don’t require R, in learning R, it will be easier to learn how to use other statistical programs and languages, such as SPSS, Stata, or Python, as well as visualization tools like Tableau, or database tools like SQL. R has some distinct advantages compared to other programs, but all programs have benefits and weaknesses Here are a couple of articles comparing R to Excel here and here Here is an article making a case for R over multiple other programs from R Bloggers Rgghhhh With all this, R does come with a learning curve. It is a programming language. In other softwares, such as Stata or SPSS, there are more “point and click” capabilities. Especially as you first work with R, you may find it is easier to do some tasks outside of R, such as with Excel or another spreadsheet software. That’s fine. Ultimately, in political science, R is one tool we can use to pursue research goals. There are many other tools, and you may find each has their own strengths and weaknesses. For this class, R provides a one-stop-shop for the wide range of types of data wrangling and analyses used across data science.

Our concepts are rich, while our measures may be very narrow or concrete. For example, GDP is one way to measure economic health, but is it the only measure? Choose measures based on validity, reliability, cost Find multiple relevant units or “data points” E.g., Multiple years of data (e.g., U.S., from 1900 to 2020) E.g., Multiple countries from one year (e.g., U.S. to Germany to other countries) Summarize the data to help answer the question 2.1.1 Example Process How is the economy doing?

"],["summarizing-univariate-data.html", "2.2 Summarizing univariate data", " 2.2 Summarizing univariate data For a video explainer of the code in this section, see below. The video only discusses the code. Use the notes and lecture discussion for additional context. (Via youtube, you can speed up the playback to 1.5 or 2x speed.) Univariate data refers to data coming from one “variable,” where a variable captures the values of a changing characteristic. Our set of values is Outcome = {0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1}. We will call this a vector of values, where a vector is just a collection of things. Because our vector contains only numbers, we will call it a numeric vector. Each value can be indexed by i, denoting the position of the value in the For example, Jesse is in position i=10 of the vector, and his value is 1 We can create vectors in R by using c() and assigning &lt;- it to an object we will call Outcome. Outcome &lt;- c(0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1) # Use commas to separate values We can extract a particular value within our vector using brackets Outcome[10] ## [1] 1 We can label our outcomes using names() names(Outcome) &lt;-c(&quot;Joe&quot;,&quot;Sally&quot;, &quot;Trevor&quot;, &quot;Emily&quot;, &quot;Mark&quot;, &quot;Sarah Jane&quot;, &quot;Stacey&quot;, &quot;Steve&quot;, &quot;Phoebe&quot;, &quot;Jesse&quot;) Outcome[10] ## Jesse ## 1 We can overwrite whole vectors or values within a vector Outcome &lt;- c(5,0,2, 6,1,1, 7, 8, 0, 1) # oops we put the wrong numbers Outcome ## [1] 5 0 2 6 1 1 7 8 0 1 Outcome &lt;- c(0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1) # no problem, just overwrite it Outcome ## [1] 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 Oops we accidentally type a 0 for Jesse.

Surveying people about their opinions on how the country doing is a common way that social scientists use description. We could extend this exercise in many ways going forward, even with the same question. Start with a question: How is the economy doing? Let’s find a measure: Ask people if the economy is doing well. Find data points: Multiple people (we could stop there with the average!), or add more variables: Across time: Survey people across multiple years Across type of people: Survey different partisan groups These types of survey trends are often used by news organizations and public opinion organizations like, Gallup. This was just a first example of description in political science. There are many other ways to describe how the economy is doing and many other topics we might want to describe in politics.

In this section, we have described voter turnout using multiple measures and types of elections. There are several other questions that political scientists may be interested in when it comes to voter turnout. For example, Texas and more than a dozen other states have passed new laws that change voting procedures in elections. What effect will these have on voter turnout? In the next section, we start to examine how to evaluate causal claims. "],["causation1.html", "Section 3 Causation with Experiments", " Section 3 Causation with Experiments Recall that we said, four primary goals of social science include: Describe and measure Has the U.S. population increased? Explain, evaluate, and recommend (study of causation) Does expanding Medicaid improve health outcomes? Predict Who will win the next election? Discover How do policies diffuse across states? In this section, we start to explore the goal of explanation–making causal claims. "],["what-separates-causation-from-correlation.html", "3.1 What separates causation from correlation?", " 3.1 What separates causation from correlation? Here’s an example. In 2016, researchers at the NY Times noticed that areas in the country where the television show Duck Dynasty was popular also tended to support Donald Trump at higher rates. If we put our social scientist hat on, we might want to distinguish whether this is a causal or, more likely, just a correlational relationship: Correlation: Areas that watch Duck Dynasty are more likely to support Trump (degree to which two variables “move together”) Causality: Watching Duck Dynasty (vs. not watching) increases your support of Trump. Causal Question: Does the manipulation of one factor (the treatment), (holding everything else constant), cause a change in an outcome? 3.1.1 Potential Outcomes Framework When studying causal relationships, we distinguish two concepts: treatment: variable whose change may produce a change in the outcome outcome (\\(Y\\)): what may change as a result We imagine two states of the world or “potential outcomes.” \\(Y(1)\\): the outcome if the treatment is administered \\(Y(0)\\): the outcome if the treatment is NOT administered (or maybe something else is) Example: How does voter turnout (\\(Y\\)) change as a result of varying whether someone receives a mail-in ballot (the treatment)? \\(Y(\\text{sent a mail-in ballot})\\): do you vote or not \\(Y(\\text{not sent a mail-in ballot})\\): do you vote or not We compare your likelihood of turning out to vote in a world where you did receive a mail-in ballot vs. a counterfactual state of the world in which you did not receive a mail-in ballot, generally assuming that this is the only thing that is different between these two potential states of the world. In many cases in social science, we might start by observing some connection in the real world (a factual observation). To make a causal claim, we then have to imagine what that counterfactual state of the world would be. Examples: Causal Question: Does the minimum wage increase the unemployment rate? (Hypothetical) Factual: An unemployment rate went up after the minimum wage increased Implied Counterfactual: Would the unemployment rate have gone up, had the minimum wage increase not occurred? Causal Question: Does race affect one’s job prospects? (Hypothetical) Factual: Jamal applied for a job but did not get it Implied Counterfactual: Would Jamal have gotten a job if he were white? We use causal logic all of the time outside of social science. For example, many viewers get angry after watching the movie Titanic because they believe Jack did not have to die. We can place their claims in our causal framework: Outcome: Jack Surviving the Titanic Potential Outcomes in two states of the world Rose did not share the floating door, and Jack died. Counterfactual question: If Rose had shared the floating door, would Jack have lived? In Bit by Bit, Matt Salganik notes that sometimes cause-and-effect questions are implicit. For example, in more general questions about maximization of some performance metric, we might want to compare several alternatives: The question “What color should the donate button be on an NGO’s website?” is really lots of questions about the effect of different button colors on donations. Factual: A voter donates some amount with a black button Counterfactual: What would a voter donate if the button were blue? Counterfactual: What would a voter donate if the button were red? What other causal questions might social scientists or data scientists ask? 3.1.2 Causal Effects When we are conducting a causal analysis, we will want to estimate a causal effect. A causal effect is the change in the outcome Y that is caused by a change in the treatment variable. \\(Y(1) - Y(0)\\) = causal effect or “treatment effect” e.g., Donation if contacted - Donation if not contacted We often want to know the average treatment effect in some population, not just the causal effect for a single individual. Here, we might ask, on average, how much would our outcome change if our units were treated instead of untreated. To do so, we simply sum up all of the causal effects and divide them by the number of units in our population. \\(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (Y_i (1)-Y_i (0))\\) = “average treatment effect” (ATE) e.g., Average donations if contacted - Average donations if not contacted 3.1.3 Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference The problem: Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference What makes the evaluation of causal claims difficult, is that in the real world, we suffer from the fundamental problem of causal inference: For any individual, we only get to see (observe) the result from one state of the world This makes that subtraction of potential outcomes impossible. (Unless we are in Groundhog Day or Russian Doll) "],["randomized-controlled-trials.html", "3.2 Randomized Controlled Trials", " 3.2 Randomized Controlled Trials One approach for addressing the fundamental problem of causal inference is to simulate two potential states of the world through random assignment: Randomized Controlled Trials / Experiments Experiments approximate factual vs. counterfactual comparison We randomly assign one group to receive a “treatment” and another not to receive a treatment (the control) When treatment assignment is randomized, the only thing that distinguishes the treatment group from the control group, besides the treatment itself, is chance. This allows us to compare the average outcomes between groups in order to estimate our causal effects (more on this below). 3.2.1 Experiments: Why Randomize? Randomization is essential for being able to “identify” and isolate the causal effect of the treatment on the outcome. Without randomization, there may be several reasons why two groups differ beyond the treatment of interest. For example, if we randomly assigned half of Rutgers seniors to watch the movie Groundhog Day and half to watch Parasite we would expect the groups to have about equal proportions of female students, average age, racial composition, majors, etc. (If we didn’t randomly assign, and just let people “select” into watching a particular movie, the groups could look very different.) But because we randomized assignment, on average, we’d expect the two groups to be identical except for the treatment– in this case, which movie they watched. Great news! This means any differences in the outcomes between the two groups can be attributed to the treatment. So if we wanted to see if Parasite leads people to have nightmares about people living in their basements, we could compare the average number of reported nightmares between the seniors that watched Parasite vs. Groundhog Day 3.2.2 Experiments: How to Analyze Difference in Means: We compare each group’s average outcome by subtracting one from the other to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) aka the average causal effect of the treatment. \\(\\widehat{ATE} = \\bar{Y}(treatment) - \\bar{Y}(control)\\) This is an estimate of, on average, how much our outcome would change if units went from being untreated to treated. E.g., on average how much a person donates to a campaign if contacted by phone compared to if not contacted by phone. 3.2.3 Ingredients of an Experiment From Bit by Bit For every experiment, you should be able to State the causal question or relationship of interest Describe how the experiment will be implemented (e.g., recruitment of subjects) Identify and describe the randomization into treatment group(s) and control group and what happens in each group Identify the outcome of interest, how it is measured Evaluate the relevant comparison We will turn to an example in the next section.

Note: When we have variables that are text-based categories, we may want to tell R to treat these “strings” of text information as factor variables, a particular type of variable that represents data as a set of nominal (unordered) or ordinal (ordered) categories. We do this with the stringsAsFactors argument. resume &lt;- read.csv(&quot;resume.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = T) resume &lt;- read.csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ktmccabe/teachingdata/main/resume.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = T) Variables and Description firstname: first name of the fictitious job applicant sex: sex of applicant (female or male) race: race of applicant (black or white) call: whether a callback was made (1 = yes, 0 = no) The data contain 4870 resumes and 4 variables. nrow(resume) # number of rows ## [1] 4870 ncol(resume) # number of columns ## [1] 4 dim(resume) # number of rows and columns ## [1] 4870 4 Note: These data look a little different from what we used last week.

Note: This is simply how R understands them. Sometimes R can get it wrong. For example, if we write: somenumbers &lt;- c(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;) class(somenumbers) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; Because we put our numbers in quotation marks, R thinks the values in somenumbers are text. The number “3” might as well be the word “blue” for all R knows. Fortunately, we can easily switch between classes. somenumbers &lt;- as.numeric(somenumbers) class(somenumbers) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; Here, we used as.numeric() to overwrite and change the character vector into a numeric vector. Rules of Thumb Usually, we want character variables to store text (e.g., open-ended survey responses) We want numeric variables to store numbers. Usually, we want factor variables to store categories. Within R, factor variables assign a number to each category, which is given a label or level in the form of text. Categories might be ordinal or “ordered” (e.g., Very likely, Somewhat likely, Not likely) or Unordered (e.g., “male”, “female”) R won’t know if a factor variable is ordered or unordered. Alas, we have to be smarter than R. R might think you have a character variable when you want it to be a factor or the reverse. That’s when as.factor() and as.character() are useful. Always check class() to find out the variable type "],["making-tables.html", "3.4 Making tables", " 3.4 Making tables A nice thing about numeric and factor variables is we can use the table command to see how many observations in our data fall into each category or numerical value. ## Example: how many black vs. white sounding resumes table(resume$race) ## ## black white ## 2435 2435 As mentioned, factor variables have levels: levels(resume$race) ## [1] &quot;black&quot; &quot;white&quot; 3.4.1 Crosstabulation We can also use the table command to show a crosstabulation: a table that displays the frequency of observations across two variables. ## Example: how many black vs. white sounding resumes by call backs ## We can label the two dimensions of the table with the = table(calledback = resume$call, race = resume$race) ## race ## calledback black white ## 0 2278 2200 ## 1 157 235 Sometimes we will want to show the proportion instead of the frequency using prop.table ## Example: proportion black vs. white sounding resumes by call backs ## Convert to proportion prop.table(table(calledback = resume$call, race = resume$race), margin = 2) # 1 for row sum, 2 for col ## race ## calledback black white ## 0 0.93552361 0.90349076 ## 1 0.06447639 0.09650924 How can we interpret this crosstabulation?

American Political Science Review, 114(2), 426-442. In the experiment, affluent Americans are randomly assigned to encounter Facebook posts in which others broadcast their economic success. These posts are designed in a way that encourages affluent respondents to view economic success as a means of achieving social status. Causal claims “I expect that exposure to these posts will cause affluent Americans to become more supportive of conservative economic policies.” “I also expect that exposure to these posts will cause especially large increases in economic conservatism among affluent men.” The experiment includes a sample of 2010 affluent Americans– people who report household incomes in the top 10 percent of the U.S. income distribution. Experiment Ingredients: Causal Question: Does desire for social status influence economic views of affluent Americans? Recruitment: Ask affluent Americans to take a survey online Randomization: Randomly assign respondents to view different fictional Facebook posts designed to signal different motivations Outcome: an index based on respondents’ support for decreasing “taxes on households making $150,000 or more a year,” support for decreasing the “taxes on money people make from selling investments, also referred to as capital gains,” and support for decreasing “government regulation of business and industry.” Comparison: Average economic views between experimental conditions.

Here, note that the data file is in a .RData format instead of .csv. This means that instead of using read.csv, we should use a function to load the data that is suitable for the .RData format. This will be load. That function works the following way: load(&quot;status.RData&quot;) After running the above code, an object will show up in your R environment. head(status) ## condition male econcon ## 2 Concrete 1 0.7500000 ## 3 Self-Esteem 1 1.0000000 ## 4 Placebo 1 0.6666667 ## 5 Self-Esteem 0 0.2500000 ## 6 Self-Esteem 0 1.0000000 ## 7 Social Approval 0 0.8333333 The data include the following variables condition: Placebo, Concrete, Self-Esteem, Social Approval, Conspicuous Consumption gender: 1= male; 0= otherwise econcon: Economic views.

Figure from Will Lowe Here is an example of the boxplot using our econcon variable. We have added a title and y-axis label to the plot through the main and ylab arguments. Play around with changing the words in those arguments. boxplot(status$econcon, main=&quot;Economic Views in the Survey Sample&quot;, ylab=&quot;Economic Views&quot;) After you execute the plot code, a preview of the plot should appear in the bottom-right window of RStudio. Boxplots are also useful for data summary across multiple distribution: boxplot(y ~ x, data = d) boxplot(econcon ~ condition, data=status, main=&quot;Economic Views by Experimental Condition&quot;, ylab=&quot;Economic Views&quot;, names = c(&quot;Placebo&quot;, &quot;Concrete&quot;, &quot;Conspicuous&quot;, &quot;Self-Esteem&quot;, &quot;Social&quot;), xlab = &quot;Experimental Condition&quot;, col = c(&quot;red3&quot;, rep(&quot;dodgerblue&quot;, 4))) The additional arguments are just aesthetics. Play around with different settings. For example, can you change the code to make the first two boxes red? Colors are supplied as a vector using the col = argument. To explore colors in R, run this function colors() in your R console. How should we interpret these results? Does status or social approval motivation, specifically, influence economic views? What about other potential motivations? "],["barplots.html", "4.3 Barplots", " 4.3 Barplots Comparing frequencies (raw N), proportions, and/or means across categories We will use the barplot() function. In contrast to the boxplot, the barplot function takes a vector of values that will serve as the top of the bars in the plot– it does not summarize a variable from within the function E.g., we could supply it a set of means to plot, not a raw variable Many of the other arguments are aesthetics that will give you deja vu after working with boxplot. This means that barplots are pretty easy to create in R. We can supply it a short vector of any values (e.g., valuesbar &lt;- c(20, 40, 50, 10, 60)), and we could also supply it a vector of any names to label those values. For real applications, this means we could supply a barplot with the output of a tapply() function, a table() summarizing a single variable, or a set of mean() values we have combined into a vector. For example, in experiments, we may use barplots to compare the mean from the treatment group(s) \\(\\bar{Y}(1)\\) to the control \\(\\bar{Y}(0)\\) on some outcome. Let’s do it! First, we need the means. Let’s find the conditional means of economic views. condmeans &lt;- tapply(status$econcon, status$condition, mean) condmeans # save as object to supply to the barplot function ## Placebo Concrete Conspicuous Consumption ## 0.6340948 0.6647485 0.6724065 ## Self-Esteem Social Approval ## 0.6564103 0.6904444 The first input is the vector of means/proportions/frequency you want to plot. barplot(condmeans, ylim = c(0,1), # y-axis dimensions names = c(&quot;Placebo&quot;, &quot;Concrete&quot;, &quot;Conspicuous&quot;, &quot;Self-Esteem&quot;, &quot;Social&quot;), col = &quot;black&quot;, # color of bars main = &quot;Mean Economic Views by Condition&quot;, # plot title cex.main = .8, # size of plot title cex.names = .8, # size of name labels ylab = &quot;Mean Views&quot;, # yaxis label cex.lab = .8,# size of yaxis label las = 1) # controls angle of axis labels The remaining arguments alter the look of the plot to make it more informative. How could we improve this plot to make the interpretation easier? 4.3.1 Saving Plots You can save an image of your plot as a png() to your working directory. Place png() just before your plot with a name in quotations, and then specify the dimensions. Place dev.off() at the bottom. png(&quot;mybarplot.png&quot;, width = 7, height = 4, res=300, units=&quot;in&quot;) barplot(condmeans, ylim = c(0,1), # y-axis dimensions names = c(&quot;Placebo&quot;, &quot;Concrete&quot;, &quot;Conspicuous&quot;, &quot;Self-Esteem&quot;, &quot;Social&quot;), col = &quot;black&quot;, # color of bars main = &quot;Mean Economic Views by Condition&quot;, # plot title cex.main = .8, # size of plot title cex.names = .8, # size of name labels ylab = &quot;Mean Views&quot;, # yaxis label cex.lab = .8,# size of yaxis label las = 1) # controls angle of axis labels dev.off() 4.3.2 Creating New Variables The author theorizes that social approval, self-esteem, and conspicuous consumption are all elements of “status motivation.” We could analyze the results by collapsing them into a single category called “status motivation” and compare it to the other experimental groups.

Let’s calculate the means. outs &lt;- tapply(marriage1$outcome, marriage1$treatmentnew, mean, na.rm=T) Note: Sometimes data include missing cells. In R, these have an NA. To ignore these when calculating a mean, we add na.rm = T to the mean() or tapply() functions. 4.4.4 Visualize means in a barplot Let’s also add a line at 0 using abline() barplot(outs, col=&quot;black&quot;, ylim = c(-2, 2), # y-axis dimensions border = NA, # removes bar borders main = &quot;Change in FT W2-W1 by Type of Treatment&quot;, # plot title cex.main = .8, # size of plot title ylab = &quot;Mean Change in FT W2-W1&quot;, # yaxis label cex.lab = .8,# size of yaxis label las = 1) # controls angle of axis labels abline(h=0, lty=2, col = &quot;red&quot;, lwd=2) # adds horizontal line at 0 with dashes How should we interpret these results? In the Marriage condition, it looks like on average, views toward gay couples became warmer (the bar is positive) after the conversations with canvassers about same-sex marriage. In contrast, the views of people in the Recycling or No Contact conditions did not change much and if anything, became slightly colder. Comparing between these bars, then, it seems like there is an “average treatment effect” given that the change in the Marriage condition was different from the Recycling an No Contact control groups. "],["scatterplots.html", "4.5 Scatterplots", " 4.5 Scatterplots It turns out that study was completely fabricated, and the article was eventually retracted. How did people know? Well a team of researchers became suspicious based on exploratory analyses they conducted with the data. Let’s do a few of these to learn about scatterplots and histograms. Scatter plots show the relationship between two numeric variables. A common way to describe and quantify a relationship is through correlation. Correlation: When \\(x\\) changes, \\(y\\) also changes by a fixed proportion Asks: If you are a certain degree above the mean of \\(x\\), are you similarly that much above the mean of \\(y\\)? Positive correlation: data cloud slopes up; Negative correlation: data cloud slopes down; High positive or negative correlation: data cluster tightly around a sloped line Not affected by changes of scale: cm vs. inch, etc. Range of Correlation is between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\) Look at the graphs below for examples of high and low positive and negative correlations. R for Dummies The plot() function in R works using x and y coordinates. We have to tell R precisely at which x- and y- coordinates to place points (e.g., place a point at x=20 and y=40) In practice, we will generally supply R with a vector of x-coordindates and a vector of corresponding y-coordinates. To illustrate a scatterplot, we will examine the relationship between the Wave 1 and Wave 2 feeling thermometer scores in the field experiment, for just the control “No Contact” condition. ## Subset data to look at control only controlonly &lt;- subset(marriage1, treatment == &quot;No Contact&quot;) In the plot(), we supply the x and y vectors. xlim and ylim specify the range of the x and y axis. pch is the point type. You can play around with that number to view different plot types plot(x=controlonly$therm1, y=controlonly$therm2, main = &quot;Relationship between W1 and W2&quot;, xlab = &quot;Wave 1&quot;, xlim = c(0, 100), ylab = &quot;Wave 2&quot;, ylim = c(0, 100), pch = 20) The correlation looks extremely high! It is positively sloped and tightly clustered. In fact, if we use R’s function to quantify a correlation between two variables, we will see it is a correlation above .99, very close to the maximum value. By default, R calculate the “pearson” correlation coefficient, a number that will be between -1 and 1. It represents the strength of the linear association between two variables. ## use = &quot;pairwise&quot; means to use all observations where neither variable has missing NA data cor(marriage1$therm1, marriage1$therm2, use = &quot;pairwise&quot;) ## [1] 0.995313 This high correlation was unusual for this type of data. Feeling thermometers suffer from low reliability. How a person answers the question at one point in time (perhaps 83) in Wave 1 often differs from the numbers they say when asked again at a future point in time in Wave 2. A person’s responses often aren’t that stable. Because there was such a high correlation, it suggested that the data might not have been generated by real human responses "],["histograms.html", "4.6 Histograms", " 4.6 Histograms The researchers later discovered the Wave 1 data was suspiciously correlated with an existing survey: 2012 CCAP. They believe the researcher likely used CCAP for Wave 1 - used survey responses from real humans that took a real survey – but not the humans that the researcher claimed to interview in the experiment. Then the researcher generated the Wave 2 data by adding random noise to the Wave 1 data Part of why they believe this has to do with a histogram plot they generated to compare Waves 1 and 2 A histogram is a useful plot for summarizing the distribution of a single variable. It shows the frequency of observations (e.g., the number of survey respondents) who give an answer within a particular interval of numeric values Because a histogram is a single variable summary, we just supply R with the numeric variable we want to summarize. The new argument here breaks tells R how many of the individual rectangles we want. You can play around with that number to see how the plot changes. hist(x=controlonly$therm1, breaks=50, main = &quot;W1 Histogram&quot;, ylim = c(0,1000)) hist(x=controlonly$therm2,breaks=50, main = &quot;W2 Histogram&quot;, ylim = c(0,1000)) The researchers noticed that the heaping patterns were different between Wave 1 and Wave 2. When real humans answer these types of feeling thermometer questions, we often see heaping (tall spikes) at values of 0, 50, and 100. Humans tend to gravitate toward those nice round numbers to anchor their responses. In addition, often researchers might recode people with missing responses (people who skip a question), as having a score of 50, increasing the number at that point. Wave 1 has a lot of this heaping– look at the higher bars around 0, 50, and 100, suggesting a lot of survey respondents gave those answers. However, Wave 2 has less heaping, particularly at 50. This suggested to the researchers that the Wave 2 data were likely generated by a computer and not real humans 4.6.1 Happy research ending While the original article was retracted Researchers who found irregularities received funding to conduct similar studies with real data this time Multiple publications suggest the canvassing approach was effective: Broockman and Kalla. 2016. “Durably reducing transphobia: A field experiment on door-to-door canvassing” Science 352 no. 6282.

What would you want to know about how movement has changed since the start of COVID? We will do an initial exploration to reveal some of the difficulties with making causal claims when we do not have the luxury of conducting an experiment. This discussion will continue in the next section. One thing that becomes apparent in the trend data is that mobility decreased substantially after mid-March of 2020. As many of us know all too well, that corresponds to shortly after the onset of the pandemic in the United States. With that said, we may ask What specifically caused the sudden decrease in mobility? Did the announcement of federal guidelines to “slow the spread” have a causal effect on mobility? Did the rise in COVID cases during that time have a causal effect on mobility? Did gubernatorial actions at the state level cause mobility to decrease? For each of these questions, we could implement the potential outcomes framework. For example, we want to compare mobility (\\(Y\\)) in the state of the world where a governor has announced social distancing and stay-at-home restrictions (\\(Y(1)_{governor}\\)) to mobility in a state of the world where the governor has not announced those restrictions (\\(Y(0)_{governor}\\)), holding everything else the same. Here we run into two problems. Our friend, the fundamental problem of causal inference. We only get to observe one state of the world for any particular governor. It would be hard to turn this into an experiment. We cannot go back in time and ask governors to come together for a field experiment that randomly assigns which states get restrictions and which do not. While there is variation– not all states had restrictions, this was not random. Likewise, if we wanted to compare mobility (\\(Y\\)) in the state of the world where the federal government has announced social distancing and stay-at-home restrictions (\\(Y(1)_{president}\\)) to mobility in a state of the world where the president has not announced those restrictions (\\(Y(0)_{president}\\)), holding everything else the same. Here we run into the same two problems. The fundamental problem of causal inference. We only get to observe one state of the world at any given point in time. It may be hard to generate an experiment that simulates the idea of these two states of the world. So what can we do? Researchers try to form comparison groups, in a strategic way, with the data they have (i.e., “observational” or “non-experimental” data). Because they cannot randomly assign two different experiences of the world, instead they choose two cases or two groups of cases that Seem extremely similar except One has the treatment of interest, and one does not Example: Before vs. After Comparison Let’s examine social mobility just before vs. just after the federal announcement of social distancing guidelines to stop the spread of COVID-19. To do so, we will draw a verticle line at March 16, 2020 Note we use abline(v=) to indicate a vertical line at a location We will also add text to inform views what that line represents Note we use text(x= , y=, labels) to indicate where to put text plot(x=covid$Dates,y=covid$Northeast, type=&quot;l&quot;, pch=15, main=&quot;Social Mobility by Date and Region&quot;, ylab=&quot;Twitter Social Mobility Index&quot;, xlab=&quot;&quot;, ylim = c(0, 80), las=1, lwd=2, bty=&quot;n&quot;, xaxt=&quot;n&quot;) lines(x=covid$Dates,y=covid$South, col=&quot;red3&quot;, lwd=2) axisdates &lt;- seq(as.Date(&quot;2019-01-01&quot;), as.Date(&quot;2021-09-01&quot;), by=&quot;month&quot;) axis(1, at = axisdates, format(axisdates, &quot;%b-%Y&quot;), las=2, cex.axis=.7) legend(&quot;bottomleft&quot;, col=c(&quot;red3&quot;, &quot;black&quot;), c(&quot;South&quot;, &quot;Northeast&quot;), cex = .7, lty=1,lwd=2, bty=&quot;n&quot;) ## add dashed blue vertical line abline(v=as.Date(&quot;2020-03-16&quot;), lty=2, col=&quot;dodgerblue&quot;, lwd=1.5) ## add text near the line ## the \\n breaks the text into different lines text(x=as.Date(&quot;2020-05-01&quot;), y=65, labels = &quot;Federal \\n Announcement&quot;, cex=.6) We see mobility does appear to be lower after the announcement relative to before the announcement. Is this causal? Assumption: We would want to be able to argue that social mobility in the weeks following the announcement (after time period) would look similar to social mobility in the weeks prior to the announcement (before period) if not for the federal announcement That the before vs. after time periods would be similar in any meaningful way if not for the presence of the treatment in the after period. Does this seem like a plausible argument? Could other things (confounders) occurring around the time of the federal announcement also have caused the steep decline in social mobility? If we think something else happened around the same time that might have caused mobility to go down anyway, then we may be doubtful that this is a causal effect. We will continue to discuss similar causal designs in the next section.

You want your visuals to be intuitive enough for a viewer to be able to interpret it without too much help from you or explanatory text elsewhere in a paper or presentation. Our goal is to help consumers of our data understand the main takeaways of our research easily and accurately.

We want to avoid colors that are hard to see or might distract consumers. The axis dimensions should not be misleading.

Create a plot plot(): for scatterplots and trend plots barplot(): for barplot comparisons across categories boxplot(): boxplot for summaries of numeric variables hist(): for histogram summaries of a single numeric variable Aesthetic arguments within a plot main =: Specifies the main title of the plot. Supply text (e.g., main = \"my title\") ylab =: Specifies the title of the y-axis. Supply text (e.g., ylab = \"Mean of variable\") xlab =: Specifies the title of the x-axis. Supply text (e.g., xlab = \"X variable name\") ylim =: Specifies the range of the y-axis. Supply vector of two numbers (e.g., ylim = c(0, 100)) xlim =: Specifies the range of the x-axis. Supply vector of two numbers (e.g., xlim = c(0, 100)) bty=\"n\": Removes the border box around the plot cex, cex.main, cex.names, cex.lab, cex.axis: Changes the size of different elements of a plot. Default is 1, so a value of .8 would be smaller than default, and 1.2 would be bigger than normal. type =: Specifies the type of plot (e.g., type=\"l\" is a line plot, type=\"b\" is a plot with points and lines connecting them) lwd=: Specifies the width of a line on a plot. Default is 1. E.g., lwd=3 makes a line much thicker pch=: Specifies the point type. E.g., pch=15 lty=: Specifies the line type. E.g., lty=2 is a dashed line col=: Specifies the color of the central element of the plot. Can take a single color or vector of colors. Use colors() in the console to see all R colors. names: Specifies a set of labels in a barplot Ways to annotate a plot (generally added below the initial plotting function) abline(): Adds a line to the plot at a particular point on the x- or y- intercept, either horizontal, vertical, or of a particular slope Example: Adding a horizontal line at a particular at a y value of 2 abline(h=2) Example: Adding a vertical line at a particular at a x value of 2 abline(v=2) lines(x=, y=): Adds a line connecting pairs of x- and y-coordinates. We used this to add the South line to the social mobility plot. axis(): Used to replace the default x- or y- axis that R will create with a customized axis To create an original y-axis, use axis(2, vectorofvalues, labels) and specify yaxt=\"n\" inside the plotting function to remove the original y-axis. To create an original x-axis, use axis(1, vectorofvalues, labels) and specify xaxt=\"n\" inside the plotting function to remove the original x-axis. legend(): Adds a legend to a plot. Can specify the location as the first argument (e.g., \"bottomleft\" or \"topright\") text(): Adds text to a plot at specific x- and y- locations. (E.g., text(x=3, y=4, \"Here is a point\"). The x and y arguments can be single numbers or a vector of numbers. x and y need to be the same length. points(): Adds points to a plot at specific x- and y- locations. Inputs are much like plot "],["a-note-on-ggplot.html", "4.12 A note on ggplot", " 4.12 A note on ggplot R has a number of open-source packages that people can use to expand the set of capabilities for visualization and analysis. These can be installed through RStudio. We will look at one of these packages: ggplot2. Using ggplot will be extra-credit at this point in the course. We may return to it later in the semester as part of the main curriculum. Reviewing this section of the notes is optional. The “gg” in ggplot2 stands for the “Grammar of Graphics.” This program provides another framework for creating figures in R. According to Hadley Wickham, “ggplot2 provides beautiful, hassle-free plots that take care of fiddly details like drawing legends.” Practically speaking, ggplot() is another tool to plot the same types of figures we have been making in class. Some people prefer ggplot2 because they find the logic of building figures more intuitive using this framework and/or more aesthetically pleasing. However, both ggplot() and the plots we have been making in class can accomplish the same ultimate goals of data visualization– to communicate information transparently, quickly, accurately, simply, and beautifully. Which types of plots you may prefer is up to your own taste. Think of packages like apps on a smartphone. If RStudio is our smartphone, we install a package like you install an app on the phone. You only have to do this once, though occasionally you may want or need to update the installation to a new version. ## Run this line in your R console install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) On a smartphone, every time you want to use an app after you have installed it, you have to open the app. Similarly, every time we want to open a package in RStudio, we have to open it by using the library() command ## Add and run this line in your R script, above the code where you will use functions from the package library(ggplot2) The main plotting function in ggplot2 is the ggplot() function. It will give you access to barplots, boxplots, scatterplots, histograms, etc. The syntax within this package is a little different from the base R plotting functions. We will investigate below. For now, here is an example of using ggplot to create a boxplot using the experiment on social status from earlier in this section. ggplot(data=status, mapping = aes(x=condition, y=econcon)) + geom_boxplot() The three primary components of a ggplot() are a dataframe (data =), a set of mapping aesthetics (aes()), and geoms (e.g., geom boxplot, geom bar, geom point, geom line, etc.). The function ggplot() first takes a dataframe that includes the values you would like to plot (e.g., data = status). The aesthetics then include the variable names that you want to plot on the x and y axis (e.g., aes(x=condition, y=econcon)) Additional mapping aesthetics can be specified. For example, a third variable (or a repeat of a previous variable) can also be specified (e.g., fill =, colour =, shape =), which acts as a grouping variable. If this is specified, ggplot() will create a corresponding legend for the plot and will color/make different shapes for different groups within this third variable (See the boxplot below for an example of grouping by condition). After closing out the first ggplot() parentheses, you then annotate the plot by adding (+) a geometric layer. This is essentially where you specify the type of plot (though it is possible to have multiple geometric layers). Just like with the other plotting functions in R, you can also specify a number of other arguments to make your plot more informative and aesthetically pleasing. Here, you do this by adding (+) additional arguments. See examples below (e.g., ggtitle, xlab, ylab for titles, ylim for y-axis limits, etc.) Likewise, just like with the other plotting functions, you can save your plots as a pdf or png. To do so here, you include the line ggsave() just below your plot. There are many more possibilities for plotting with ggplot(), but these should get you started. For additional resources on all that is gg, I recommend the R Graphics Cookbook. Here is a second version of the boxplot with more aesthetics specified. We will color in the boxes based on the collapsed condition variable. ggplot(data=status, mapping = aes(x=condition, y=econcon, fill=conditionnew)) + ## Specifies plot type. E.g., also have geom_point(), geom_bar() geom_boxplot()+ ## Note many arguments are similar to other R functions but the syntax is a little different ggtitle(&quot;Economic Views by Experimental Condition&quot;)+ ylab(&quot;Economic Views&quot;)+ xlab(&quot;Experimental Condition&quot;)+ ylim(0,1)+ ## Changes the overall theme (i.e., color scheme, borders, etc.) theme_bw()+ theme(legend.position=&quot;bottom&quot;) ggsave(&quot;myboxplot.pdf&quot;, width=7, height=5) Here is an example of a histogram from the application on views toward gay couples. ggplot(controlonly, aes(x=therm1)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + ggtitle(&quot;W1 Histogram&quot;) + theme_minimal() Instead of displaying multiple categories through different shapes or colors, we could also create multiple mini plots instead. This is done through facet. Let’s look at a histogram for each condition for the thermometers in wave 2. ggplot(marriage1, aes(x=therm2)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + ggtitle(&quot;W2 Histogram by Condition&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Feeling Thermometer Wave 2&quot;)+ theme_bw()+ facet_wrap(~treatmentnew) ## Warning: Removed 1042 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).

"],["causal-identification-strategies.html", "5.2 Causal Identification Strategies", " 5.2 Causal Identification Strategies Our goal: Try to “identify” the causal effect of one variable on an outcome. As Montell Jordan once said, this is how we do it: Use data we have (that exist out in the world) Compare those who are ``treated” to a relevant comparison group who is not treated However, we can’t randomize treatment so…. We do our best to try to choose a good comparison (one very similar to the treatment group, but happens not to be treated) We want to rule out all possible confounding variables and “alternative explanations” for the outcomes we observed. 5.2.1 Three Common Identification Strategies Example: Does drinking Sprite make a person a better basketball player? (Inspired by 1990s commercial where a kid believes drinking Sprite will cause him to play basketball better.) Cross-section comparison: Compare Grant Hill (who drinks Sprite) to others (who don’t) Before-and-after: Compare Grant Hill after he started drinking Sprite to Grant Hill before Difference-in-differences: Compare Grant Hill before and after drinking Sprite and subtract from this the difference for some other person (who never drank Sprite) during the same two periods (Note: “drinking Sprite” is our treatment.) 5.2.2 Threats to Cross-Section Designs Assumption: Must assume no confounders and any alternative explanations related to differences between the treated and control subjects that also relate to the outcome. The Threat: Your two groups may differ in ways beyond the “treatment” in ways that are relevant to the outcome you care about. Compare Grant Hill, a tall NBA player who currently drinks Sprite (treatment group) to Yourself, assuming you and they do not drink Sprite (control group) Compare your basketball skill levels (the outcome). Suppose Grant Hill is better (a positive treatment effect). Can we conclude Sprite causes a person to be a better player? Nope, because other things that affect basketball talent differ between you and Grant Hill, and these things, not Sprite, may explain the difference in basketball talent. Moreover, even if we compared just among NBA players (Grant Hill vs. non-Sprite drinking players of his era), it’s possible that Sprite targeted all-stars to recruit to drink Sprite. In this way, pre-existing basketball talent (a confounder) both explains why Grant Hill drank Sprite (relates to the treatment) and explains his higher level of basketball talent (relates to the outcome) in the time period after drinking Sprite. For a cross-sectional comparison to be plausible, we need to choose a very similar comparison in order to isolate the treatment as the main variable that is causing a change in an outcome. 5.2.3 Threats to Before-After Designs Assumption: Must assume no confounding time trend. Threat: Something else may be changing over time, aside from the treatment, that is affecting your outcome. Compare Grant Hill in the years after he started drinking Sprite (treated) to Grant Hill the years before he started drinking Sprite (control) Compare his basketball skill levels (outcome). Suppose Grant Hill after Sprite is better (a positive treatment effect). Can we conclude Sprite causes a person to be a better player? Not if something else Grant Hill started doing during that time period made him better (e.g., maybe during that time the NBA provided higher quality coaches and trainers, and everyone (including Grant Hill) got better). You want your treatment to be the only thing relevant to basketball talent changing over time. 5.2.4 Threats to Diff-in-Diff Designs Assumption: Must assume parallel trends: That in the absence of treatment, your treatment group would have changed in the same way as your control Compare Grant Hill in the years before vs. after he started drinking Sprite to Grant Hill’s teammate, who never drank sprite, in the same two time periods (before Hill drinks Sprite vs. after Hill drinks Sprite) Compare the change in each player’s basketball skill levels. Suppose Grant Hill’s skills increased to a greater degree than his teammate’s over the same time period. Can we conclude Sprite causes a person to be a better player? If we are confident that Grant Hill did not have a unique (non-Sprite) advantage over that time period relative to other players, then our assumption might be plausible– that Grant Hill and other players would have experienced a similar growth in their skills if not for Grant Hill getting the extra benefit of Sprite. Instead, if, for example, Grant Hill got a new trainer during this period AND his teammate did not, then we might have expected Grant Hill to see more improvement even if he didn’t start drinking Sprite. A violation of the parallel trends assumption! Causality is hard!

"],["the-anatomy-of-a-loop.html", "6.1 The anatomy of a loop", " 6.1 The anatomy of a loop In many situations, we want to repeat the same calculations with different inputs. Loops allow you to avoid writing many similar code chunks. The function for(i in X){}} will create a loop in your programming code where i is a counter and X is a placeholder for a vector for the possible values of the counter. We use the following syntax: for (i in X) { command1... command2... ... } to indicate we want to repeat command1 and command2 and …. as many commands as we want, for each i in the set of possible values for i stored in X. 6.1.1 The key parts of a loop The meat: the command or set of commands you want to do over and over. ## the meat result &lt;- 6 + 2 result &lt;- 8 + 2 result &lt;- 4 + 2 result &lt;- 7 + 2 result &lt;- 11 + 2 Note the pattern: we take some number and + 2 each time. It is the number that is changing -&gt; what we will iterate. For a loop, you want to: The Meat: Write down the code for one version. result &lt;- 6 + 2 The Bread: Embed this code in the loop syntax (for(i in X){}) for(i in X){ result &lt;- 6 + 2 } Create a vector that contains the values you want to loop through somenumbers &lt;- c(6, 8, 4, 7, 11) Create a storage vector that will contain the results result &lt;- rep(NA, length(somenumbers)) Modify the meat and bread to iterate by using [i], and replace X. for(i in 1:length(somenumbers)){ result[i] &lt;- somenumbers[i] + 2 } where `1:length(somenumbers)` reflects possible values `i` will take 1:length(somenumbers) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6.1.2 A short example Let’s put these parts together: Suppose we want to add 2 to a set of numbers c(6, 8, 4, 7, 11) somenumbers &lt;- c(6, 8, 4, 7, 11) # iteration vector result &lt;- rep(NA, length(somenumbers)) # container vector for(i in 1:length(somenumbers)){ result[i] &lt;- somenumbers[i] + 2 } result ## [1] 8 10 6 9 13 How does this work? Every iteration, the value of i changes. For example, when i is 1, we take the first value in our somenumbers vector somenumbers[1], add 2 to it, and store it in the first position of our container vector result[1]. When i is 2, we switch the number in the brackets to 2, corresponding to the second entry in each vector, and so on. # Suppose i is 1 result[1] &lt;- somenumbers[1] + 2 result[1] ## [1] 8 # Suppose i is 2 result[2] &lt;- somenumbers[2] + 2 result[2] ## [1] 10 # Suppose i is 3 result[3] &lt;- somenumbers[3] + 2 result[3] ## [1] 6 6.1.3 Troubleshooting a loop The inside part of the loop should run if we set i to a particular value. i &lt;- 1 result[i] &lt;- somenumbers[i] + 2 If you get an error here, there is something wrong with the meat! (and not necessarily the loop) result[i] ## [1] 8 For example, if we had a typo, we’d get an error.

Ideology on the U.S. Supreme Court: With Kennedy out, Kavanaugh in, did the Court have a Conservative shift? Many people predicted it would. See this FiveThirtyEight article as an example. The graph from the article shows Kavanaugh’s predicted ideology. We will explore how he changed the Court, with a focus on how the location of the median U.S. Supreme Court Justice shifted over time. For a video explainer of the code for this application, see below. (Via youtube, you can speed up the playback to 1.5 or 2x speed.) The link to the video is https://youtu.be/gA1OZ8-SO9E. Why does the median matter? A refresher on the Court President nominates the justice. Senate must confirm. Justices serve lifetime appointments. Trump nominated Gorsuch, following Scalia death, confirmed 2017. Trump nominated Kavanaugh, following Kennedy retirement, confirmed 2018. The Court typically has 9 justices, so whichever justice is the median in terms of ideology, can act as the “swing” vote in cases where the Court is divided Anthony Kennedy was often the “swing” justice for a decade. With Kennedy out, the prediction is that the Court would return to similar balance as when O’Connor was the median. In 2020, Amy Coney Barrett confirmed to Court, likely shifting the Court again. We can continue to update the data to examine what happened. Let’s load and explore our data. term: is the year of the SC (1991-2019 except for 2005), justiceName: contains the name of the Justice, and post_mn: includes the “ideal point”– this is the estimated ideology Martin-Quinn Scores assess ideology based on how judges “cluster” together in their voting patterns. Every Justice gets an ideology score, and this score can change each SC term (year) they are on the Court. Higher scores are more conservative justices, and lower, more liberal. More information is available at the MQScores website justices &lt;- read.csv(&quot;justices.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = T) ## alternative justices &lt;- read.csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ktmccabe/teachingdata/main/justices.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = T) We are going to make the name variable a character class. This will make R treat the names as raw text rather than valued categories. This will be useful later on in the application. ## justice Name as character justices$justiceName &lt;- as.character(justices$justiceName) We can use tapply() to see the median “ideal point” (ideology score) each term in our data. ## Note: we use tapply like before but replace mean with median medians &lt;- tapply(justices$post_mn, justices$term, median) plot(x =names(medians), y= medians, ylim = c(-.4, 1), type = &quot;b&quot;, cex=1.5, ylab=&quot;Conservatism&quot;, xlab=&quot;Term&quot;, main=&quot;Median of US Supreme Court over Time&quot;) We see a conservative shift at the end of the plot. However, we cannot tell whether this represents a shift within a particular justice’s ideology or a shift in which justice has become the median, due perhaps, to the change in the Court’s composition. We need to find which justice is the median! Loops to the rescue! We will start our process by definding the meat of the operation. We want to find the median SC Justice for each term. To get started, let’s pretend we only have to find the median Supreme Court Justice for one term. SCterms &lt;- sort(unique(justices$term)) SCterms ## [1] 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2006 ## [16] 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Note that where you have a vector where some entries in the vector are repeated (such as terms on the Supreme Court), you can extract the unique elements of that vector using the unique() function. You can also sort() them in numeric or alphabetical order. This won’t be necessary most times. First, let’s think about how we would do this for just one of the Supreme Court terms. Well we would first subset our data frame to contain only that one Supreme Court term. ## Example for the first term SCterms[1] ## [1] 1991 ## Subset data to include only rows from 1991 subterm &lt;- subset(justices, term == 1991) Then, we would take the median of these ideal points median.ip &lt;- median(subterm$post_mn) Finally, we would figure out which justice has this median. result &lt;- subterm$justiceName[subterm$post_mn == median.ip] result ## [1] &quot;SDOConnor&quot; Now let’s put it into our loop syntax # for(i in . . . ){ # subterm &lt;- subset(justices, term == 1991) # median.ip &lt;- median(subterm$post_mn) # result &lt;- subterm$justiceName[subterm$post_mn == median.ip] #} Now, we need our container vector and iteration vectors. SCterms &lt;- sort(unique(justices$term)) results &lt;- rep(NA, length(SCterms)) names(results) &lt;- SCterms Finally, we would modify our loop syntax with i and [i] for(i in 1:length(SCterms)){ subterm &lt;- subset(justices, term == SCterms[i]) median.ip &lt;- median(subterm$post_mn) results[i] &lt;- subterm$justiceName[subterm$post_mn == median.ip] } Did it work? results ## 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 ## &quot;SDOConnor&quot; &quot;SDOConnor&quot; &quot;AMKennedy&quot; &quot;SDOConnor&quot; &quot;AMKennedy&quot; &quot;AMKennedy&quot; ## 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 ## &quot;AMKennedy&quot; &quot;AMKennedy&quot; &quot;SDOConnor&quot; &quot;SDOConnor&quot; &quot;SDOConnor&quot; &quot;SDOConnor&quot; ## 2003 2004 2006 2007 2008 2009 ## &quot;SDOConnor&quot; &quot;SDOConnor&quot; &quot;AMKennedy&quot; &quot;AMKennedy&quot; &quot;AMKennedy&quot; &quot;AMKennedy&quot; ## 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 ## &quot;AMKennedy&quot; &quot;AMKennedy&quot; &quot;AMKennedy&quot; &quot;AMKennedy&quot; &quot;AMKennedy&quot; &quot;AMKennedy&quot; ## 2016 2017 2018 2019 ## &quot;AMKennedy&quot; &quot;JGRoberts&quot; &quot;JGRoberts&quot; &quot;JGRoberts&quot; 6.2.1 Troubleshooting the loop Recall, the inside part of the loop should run if we set i to a particular value. i &lt;- 1 subterm &lt;- subset(justices, term == SCterms[i]) median.ip &lt;- median(subterm$post_mn) results[i] &lt;- subterm$justiceName[subterm$post_mn == median.ip] results[i] ## 1991 ## &quot;SDOConnor&quot; We are in good shape! If we had a typo, we’d get an error message there, and that would be a sign that we need to work on the inside part of the code before putting it back into the loop structure. 6.2.2 Visualizing the Results To get a bit more practice with plots, let’s visualize the results and make our interpretations. medians &lt;- tapply(justices$post_mn, justices$term, median) plot(x =names(medians), y= medians, ylim = c(-.4, 1), type = &quot;b&quot;, cex=1.5, ylab=&quot;Conservatism&quot;, xlab=&quot;Term&quot;, main=&quot;Median of US Supreme Court over Time&quot;) ## Add the names to the plot ## Note: we want to make sure medians and results are in the same order for this to work text(x=names(results), y=(medians - .14), labels=results, cex=.35) We have now used the text() function. Similar to plot, the text() takes a set of x and y coordinates that tells R the location of where you want to add a piece(s) of text to the plot. The third input is the actual text. Why did the Court shift more conservative at the end of the time trend? Well we see that Justice Roberts became the median! As FiveThirtyEight notes, just because Justice Roberts is the new median, does not mean he has become more liberal. The Court composition is shifting, and the MQ scores also depend on the issues being heard before the Court. Recall, the Martin-Quinn scores measure justice ideology based on voting patterns. What are the strengths and weaknesses of using this type of information to score the ideology of a justice? 6.2.3 Enhancing the plot Let’s make the plot more beautiful by color coding. medians &lt;- tapply(justices$post_mn, justices$term, median) plot(x =names(medians), y= medians, ylim = c(-.4, 1), type = &quot;b&quot;, ylab=&quot;Conservatism&quot;, xlab=&quot;Term&quot;, main=&quot;Median of US Supreme Court over Time&quot;, xaxt=&quot;n&quot;, ## removes the x-axis las=1) ## Adds text text(x=names(results), y=(medians - .14), results, cex=.35) ## Adds color-coded points on top of existing points points(x =names(medians), y= medians, ## Adds colors according to how results is coded col= ifelse(results == &quot;AMKennedy&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, ifelse(results ==&quot;SDOConnor&quot;, &quot;light blue&quot;, &quot;purple&quot;)), pch=15, # point type- squares cex=1.5) # size of points ## Adds custom x-axis at the specific years included in names(medians) axis(1, names(medians), cex.axis=.6) We have used the points() function. This adds an additional layer of points to a plot. It works much like the plot function in that in takes a set of x and y coordinates. We could change the look of the plot even more by adding a legend and altering the borders and look of the plot. medians &lt;- tapply(justices$post_mn, justices$term, median) plot(x =names(medians), y= medians, ylim = c(-.4, 1), type = &quot;b&quot;, ylab=&quot;Conservatism&quot;, xlab=&quot;Term&quot;, main=&quot;Median of US Supreme Court over Time&quot;, xaxt=&quot;n&quot;, # removes x axis las=1, # changes the orientation of the axis labels lwd=2, # increases the thickness of the lines tick=F, # removes the tick marks from the axis bty=&quot;n&quot;) # removes the plot border ## adds horizontal dashed gray lines abline(h=seq(-.4, 1, .2), lty=2, col=&quot;light gray&quot;) ## Adds a legend legend(&quot;bottomleft&quot;, pch=15, col = c(&quot;orange&quot;, &quot;light blue&quot;, &quot;purple&quot;), c(&quot;Kennedy&quot;, &quot;O&#39;Connor&quot;, &quot;Roberts&quot;), bty=&quot;n&quot;) ## Adds the color-coded points points(x =names(medians), y= medians, col= ifelse(results == &quot;AMKennedy&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, ifelse(results ==&quot;SDOConnor&quot;, &quot;light blue&quot;, &quot;purple&quot;)), pch=15, cex=2) ## Adds our custom x-axis axis(1, names(medians), cex.axis=.6, tick=F) 6.2.4 Wrapping Up We have calculated and visualized how the median U.S. Supreme Court Justice and Justice’s ideology has changed over the past three decades. This gave us additional practice with loops and visualization We also gained exposure to an example of how political scientists take a large amount of information– votes on all Supreme Court cases– and try to summarize it using a single number that represents how liberal or conservative a justice is This type of information can be used for many social science goals: 1) To describe trends in the Court 2) To help explain why the Court has voted a particular way on recent cases 3) To predict how the Court will vote in the future as new justices arrive. With Amy Coney Barrett now on the Court, we can start to see initial changes in the Court composition. The MQ scores will continue to be updated to allow for future exploration of these dynamics.

Now we turn to a different goal. Recall the difference between Correlation vs. Causality using our graphic showing the popularity of Duck Dynasty in different parts of the country. In 2016, researchers at the NY Times noticed that areas in the country where the television show Duck Dynasty was popular also tended to support Donald Trump at higher rates. For those used to working with the goal of explanation, shifting to prediction and classification may mean we need to shift what types of information we think is important. Correlation: Areas that watch Duck Dynasty are more likely to support Trump (degree to which two variables ``move together”) Causality: Watching Duck Dynasty (vs. not watching) causes you to support Trump. If we were interested in the goal of explaining voting decisions (what causes someone to vote a certain way?), we might not care if someone watches the show. However, if we were just interested in predicting vote share or voting decisions, a strong correlation could still be useful.

Pew This led public opinion scholars and practitioners to do a deep investigation into the quality of pre-election polling. Like 2016, following the 2020 election, a similar team investigated the quality of pre-election polling in 2020. Here, while many polls pointed to a favorable outcome for Biden, the results seemed closer than one might have anticipated. The results of these findings are in the AAPOR report. 7.4.1 Choose an approach: Let’s analyze some polls We are going to do our own analysis of pre-election polls as a prediction of the 2020 election results.

Negative mean Trump was ahead/won. Let’s predict the amount of electoral votes for Biden based on polls in each state close to Election Day. Let’s start with 1 state.

"],["step-1-approach--regression-in-r.html", "8.3 Step 1: Approach- Regression in R", " 8.3 Step 1: Approach- Regression in R A regression draws a “best fit line” between the points. This allows us – for any given OBP – to estimate the number of runs scored. Our best prediction of the number of runs scored would be the spot on the purple line directly above a given OBP. The regression model is \\(Y = \\alpha + \\beta X + \\epsilon\\). Let’s demystify this. A regression model describes the relationship between one or more independent variables \\(X\\) (explanatory variables) and an outcome variable \\(Y\\) (dependent variable) For example, the relationship between our independent variable, On Base Percentage, and our dependent variable, Runs Scored We want to know what happens with our dependent variable \\(Y\\) if our independent variable \\(X\\) increases. As we increase our On Base Percentage, a regression model will help us estimate how much we should expect our Runs Scored to increase (or decrease) \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are considered “parameters” – things we don’t know but want to estimate. These two numbers will define exactly how we think \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are related. No two variables are perfectly related, so we also have the \\(\\epsilon\\) term, which describes the error in the model When we have data, we estimate \\(Y\\), \\(\\alpha\\), and \\(\\beta\\): \\(\\hat Y = \\hat \\alpha + \\hat \\beta X\\). The \\({\\hat{hat}}\\) over the letters means those are our estimated values. In R, the regression syntax is fit &lt;- lm(y ~ x, data = mydata) fit is just whatever you want to call the output of the model, y is the name of the dependent variable, x is the name of the independent variable, and mydata is whatever you have called your dataframe. E.g.: fit &lt;- lm(RS ~ OBP, data = baseball) When we have data, we estimate \\(Y\\), \\(\\alpha\\), and \\(\\beta\\): \\(\\hat Y = \\hat \\alpha + \\hat \\beta X\\). Our model gives us the “coefficient” estimates for \\(\\hat \\alpha\\) and \\(\\hat \\beta\\). coef(fit) ## (Intercept) OBP ## -1076.602 5490.386 The first coefficient is \\(\\hat \\alpha\\), this represents the intercept – the estimated value our dependent variable will take if our independent variable is 0. The value the estimated runs scored would be if a team had a 0.000 on base percentage. In our case, this value is estimated to be negative, which is impossible (but it would also be unusual for a team to have a 0.000 on base percentage). Therefore, the intercept isn’t inherently substantively interesting to us. The second coefficient is \\(\\hat \\beta\\) is the slope This represents the expected change in our dependent variable for a 1-unit increase in our independent variable. For example, if we go from a 0.000 on base percentage to a 1.000 on base percentage, we would expect a 5490.4 increase in runs scored. Note: slope can be positive or negative similar to correlation. Note: slope is in the units of the dependent variable (e.g., runs). It is not constrained to be between -1 and 1. It is telling us that the greater the OBP, the better! 8.3.1 Visualizing a regression We can plot the regression using a scatterplot and abline(). plot(x=baseball$OBP, y=baseball$RS, ylab = &quot;Runs Scored&quot;, xlab = &quot;On Base Percentage&quot;, main=&quot;Runs Scored by On Base Percentage&quot;, pch=20) ## Add regression line abline(fit, lwd=3, col = &quot;purple&quot;) # add line 8.3.2 Making predictions with regression A regression model allows us to estimate or “predict” values of our dependent variable for a given value of our independent variable. The red dot represents our estimate (best prediction) of the number of runs scored if a team has an on base percentage of .300. In R, we can calculate this value using predict(). The syntax is predict(fit, data.frame(x = value)) where fit is the name of the model, x is the name of the independent variable, and value represents the value for the independent variable for which you want to predict your outcome (e.g., .300). predict(fit, data.frame(OBP=.300)) ## 1 ## 570.5137 Under the hood, this is just using the regression formula described above. For example, to estimate the number of runs scored for a .300 on base percentage, we take \\(\\hat \\alpha + \\hat \\beta * .300\\) Note that below we compare the output of the predict function to our output if we manually calculated the estimated value. predict(fit, data.frame(OBP=.300)) ## 1 ## 570.5137 # a + b*.300 coef(fit)[1] + coef(fit)[2]*.300 ## (Intercept) ## 570.5137 Let’s say a team thought they needed about 900 runs scored to get to the playoffs, and they were pretty sure they could get a team on base percentage of .500. How many runs would they be expected to score with that OBP? Do you think they will make the playoffs? Try on your own, then expand for the solution. predict(fit, data.frame(OBP=.500)) ## 1 ## 1668.591 It’s greater than 900, so we should feel good about our chances.

Recall that a regression tries to draw a “best fit line” between the points of data. Under the hood of the regression function, we are searching for the values of \\(\\hat \\alpha\\) and \\(\\hat \\beta\\) that try to minimize the distance between the individual points and the regression line. This distance is called the residual: \\(\\hat \\epsilon_i = Y_i - \\hat Y_i\\). This is our prediction error: How far off our estimate of Y is (\\(\\hat Y_i\\)) from the true value of Y (\\(Y_i\\)) Linear regressions choose \\(\\hat \\alpha\\) and \\(\\hat \\beta\\) to minimize the “squared distance” of this error (think of this as the magnitude of the distance). This is why we tend to call this type of linear regression ordinary least squares (OLS regression). If instead we chose the red line in the image below to be the regression line, you can see that the typical prediction error would be much larger. That’s why we end up with the purple line. 8.4.1 Root Mean Squared Error Just like we had root mean squared error in our poll predictions, we can calculate this for our regression.

See this academic paper for an elaboration of the evidence that “The Butterfly [ballot] Did it.” 8.7.3 Confidence Intervals Social scientists like to characterize the uncertainty in their predictions using what is called a “confidence interval.” Confidence intervals show a range of values that are likely to contain the true value predict(fit, data.frame(Perot96 = 13600), interval = &quot;confidence&quot;) ## fit lwr upr ## 1 489.7903 394.8363 584.7443 By default, R supplies the 95% confidence interval. For example, our estimate is for a county with 13,600 votes for Perot in 1996, the expected Buchanan vote is 489.79 votes. The confidence interval is 394.84 to 584.74 votes, which means we believe there is a 95% chance that this interval contains the true value of the Buchanan 2000 vote share. Instead of thinking about our prediction as just 489.79, we should think about the entire interval as having a good chance of including the true value. Similarly, our coefficients also have uncertainty. coef(fit) ## (Intercept) Perot96 ## 1.34575212 0.03591504 confint(fit) ## 2.5 % 97.5 % ## (Intercept) -98.03044506 100.72194929 ## Perot96 0.02724733 0.04458275 For every 1 vote increase in the Perot 1996 vote, we expect a \\(\\hat \\beta =.036\\) increase in Buchanan votes. However, the confidence interval is 0.027 to 0.045. We think there is a 95% chance that this interval 0.027 to 0.045 includes the true \\(\\beta\\), describing the rate of change in Buchanan votes for a given change in Perot 1996 votes "],["cross-validation.html", "8.8 Cross-Validation", " 8.8 Cross-Validation So far, we’ve been “cheating.” We’ve been analyzing a prediction in cases where we know the right answer. Now we will focus more squarely on how to develop an “out-of-sample” prediction. Problem: Models that fit our existing (“in-sample”) data might not be the best for predicting out-of-sample data. Example: Compare regression line with vs. without Palm Beach included in the sample. Outliers “in-sample” can lead to overfitting to weird, idiosyncratic data points Example: Error Rates in Speech Recognition. See study here Predictions/Classification that works well for one group might not work well for all groups Problem: Models that fit our existing (“in-sample”) data might not be the best for predicting out-of-sample data. Approaches to diagnose the problem or help address it: Detect potential outliers within existing data by exploring the prediction errors Make sure the training (in-sample) data is as representative as possible Incorporate out-of-sample testing in prediction process 8.8.1 Cross-Validation Process Cross-validation incorporates the idea of out-of-sample testing into the process of how we evaluate the accuracy of prediction and classification approaches. Cross-validation (train vs. test data) Subset your data into two portions: Training and Test data. Run a model based on the training data. Make a prediction and test the accuracy on the test data. Repeat process training and testing on different portions of the data. Summarize the results and choose a preferred model Eventually: Apply this model to entirely new data Goal: Test accuracy in a way that can help detect overfitting. See how well our model will generalize to new data (data the model hasn’t seen). 8.8.2 Application: Forecasting Election Results Macro political and economic fundamentals are sometimes used for early forecasting of an election. We will build a version of this model and test its accuracy using a process of “Leave-one-out” cross-validation. Below is a video explainer of this application, which uses cross-validation. The data and model are based on the FAIR model of forecasting. fair &lt;- read.csv(&quot;fair.csv&quot;) Key Variables: VP: Democratic share of the two-party presidential vote t: Year (presidential years only) G: growth rate of real per capita GDP in the first 3 quarters P: growth rate of the GDP deflator in the first 15 quarters of the recent administration Z: number of quarters in the first 15 quarters of recent administration in which the growth rate of real per capita GDP is greater than 3.2 percent at an annual rate I: 1 if Democrats in WH and -1 if Republicans in WH WAR: 1 if 1920, 1944, 1948 (denoting the ``WAR” elections, which are believed to be particular) DUR: indicating how many consecutive terms Democrats/Republicans have been office (e.g., in 2020 it will be 0 because Republicans will have been in office for only 1 term.) Let’s propose a model fit &lt;- lm(VP ~ DUR, data = fair) Let’s propose an alternative model and see which one we think is better. fit2 &lt;- lm(VP ~ G*I + DUR, data = fair) Note: The asterisk represents an “interaction.” See QSS Chapter 4.

Yes, in our prediction/classification sections, we have done a type of it. We have used a statistical model (in this case, regression) to learn and make inferences about patterns in data. A regression can be considered a type of algorithm We then apply the model to new data to make predictions and classify new data into categories.

Prediction and classification models are used all of the time in public policy, including in the criminal justice system: “where crimes will most likely occur, who is most likely to commit a violent crime, who is likely to fail to appear at their court hearing, and who is likely to reoffend at some point in the future” (Dressel and Farid) Dressel and Farid develop and examine models that predict whether someone will recidivate– based on a measure of rearrest. They compare their own models to COMPAS (a well-known proprietary algorithm that generates risk scores) and to human-based predictions We will develop a model similar to the one Dressel and Farid use in their paper, which seems to closely approximate COMPAS predictions. Note: These algorithms have generated a lot of debate, concern and controversy, which we will discuss. 9.1.1 Load data Below is a video explainer of this application, which uses classification and cross-validation.

We estimate the probability of recidivism– a number between 0 and 1. There are downsides to using linear regression with this type of outcome. Data scientists may often use a different model called logistic regression for this.

Logistic regression will constrain these due to a transformation it makes when estimating the coefficients. 9.1.3.1 Detour: Logistic Regression As an alternative, you could use logistic regression, which data scientists may often use when trying to do a classification task– predicting which category a subject belongs to (e.g., recidivate vs. not recidivate; turned out to vote vs. did not turn out to vote). We won’t focus on logistic regression in this class, but you can know it is out there for future study. Step 1: Choose Approach- Let’s try logistic regression instead For details, expand. ## Logistic regression fitl &lt;- glm(two_year_recid ~ age + sex + juv_misd_count + juv_fel_count + priors_count + charge_degree, data = broward, family=binomial(link = &quot;logit&quot;)) ## estimates a predicted probability of recidivism for each subject broward$predictedrecl &lt;- predict(fitl, type=&quot;response&quot;) # need type=&quot;response&quot; to make them probabilities ## Range of predicted probabilities of recidivism range(broward$predictedrecl) ## [1] 0.04176846 0.99891808 Logistic regression keeps probabilities between 0 and 1 due to a transformation it applies to our standard regression formula. As a result, our coefficient units (coef(fitl)) are in log-odds units, which are hard to interpret. We can transform our predictions of the model into probabilities using the predict() function with type = \"response\". We can compare the predictions of the probability of recidivism between the linear and logistic regression models. Note how the linear model blows past 0 and 1, while the logistic-based predictions can keep them within those bounds. We don’t have time to go into the math of logistic regression in this course, but know that it is a desirable option for classification. For now, let’s stick with the linear model. 9.1.3.2 Change Prediction into a Classification Recall: we are trying to classify We need to make our estimates of the probability of recidivism categorical, into simply a prediction of recidivate vs. not recidivate For now, we will use .5 as a threshold (a probability of more than .5) # Need to make prediction binary. # We use .5, but there are other methods for choosing this threshold broward$predictedrecclass &lt;- ifelse(broward$predictedrec &gt; .5, 1, 0) Predicted Recidivism table(predicted=broward$predictedrecclass) ## predicted ## 0 1 ## 4683 2531 9.1.4 Step 2: Check Accuracy We are going to get extra practice with cross-validation as a way to check accuracy. Recall: Cross-validation (train vs. test data) Subset your data into two portions: Training and Test data. Run a model based on the training data. Make a prediction and test the accuracy on the test data. Repeat process training and testing on different portions of the data. Summarize the results and choose a preferred model Eventually: Apply this model to entirely new data Goal: Test accuracy in a way that can help detect overfitting. See how well our model will generalize to new data (data the model hasn’t seen). We will use leave-one-out cross-validation again, but there are other methods, such as splitting data into “folds” of multiple observations at once (i.e., leaving out 100 or 1000 observations for testing instead of just 1). ## Step 1: Subset Data traindata &lt;- broward[-1,] # all but first row testdata &lt;- broward[1,] # just the first row ## Step 2: Run model on training data fittrain &lt;- lm(two_year_recid ~ age + sex + juv_misd_count + juv_fel_count + priors_count + charge_degree, data = traindata) ## Step 3: Predict with test data predictedrec &lt;- predict(fittrain, testdata) ## Step 3: Change predicted probability into a classification cvpredictions &lt;- ifelse(predictedrec &gt; .5, 1, 0) Step 4: Repeat across all observations and summarize accuracy. We want to repeat this process for every row of our data– leaving out a different row each time. To construct our loop, we embed the above process in the loop syntax. ## Iteration vector ## 1:nrow(broward) ## Container vector broward$cvpredictions &lt;- NA for(i in 1:nrow(broward)){ ## Step 1: Subset Data traindata &lt;- broward[-i,] # all but ith row testdata &lt;- broward[i,] # just the ith row ## Step 2: Run model on training data fittrain &lt;- lm(two_year_recid ~ age + sex + juv_misd_count + juv_fel_count + priors_count + charge_degree, data = traindata) ## Step 3: Predict with test data predictedrec &lt;- predict(fittrain, testdata) broward$cvpredictions[i] &lt;- ifelse(predictedrec &gt; .5, 1, 0) } 9.1.4.1 Confusion Matrix Check Accuracy: Confusion Matrix confmatrix &lt;- table(actual = broward$two_year_recid, predicted = broward$cvpredictions) confmatrix ## predicted ## actual 0 1 ## 0 3156 807 ## 1 1528 1723 How should we interpret each cell?

Iterate The performance of a prediction/classification may be different for different groups in the population. Dressel and Farid point to this when it comes to different racial groups. Dressel and Farid Let’s see how our predictions perform across racial groups race: 1: White (Caucasian); 2: Black (African American); 3: Hispanic; 4: Asian; 5: Native American; 6: Other Wait a second– we didn’t use race in our model. Why could the performance still differ across racial groups? Think about how the inputs in our regression model could be correlated with race. Think about how existing human biases and inequalities that lead to differential arrest rates by racial groups could be reproduced in our model. Even if a model does not have the intent to include race, its impact may nonetheless vary according to race. This could be true for any number of characteristics depending on the application. We will subset our data by race. black &lt;- subset(broward, race == 2) white &lt;- subset(broward, race == 1) We can first check overall accuracy mean(black$cvpredictions == black$two_year_recid) ## [1] 0.6696429 mean(white$cvpredictions == white$two_year_recid) ## [1] 0.6805216 But are we making the same types of errors? ## False positive rate- Black ## Out of those who do not recidivate, how often did we predict recidivate? fprate.black &lt;- sum(black$cvpredictions == 1 &amp; black$two_year_recid == 0) / sum(black$two_year_recid == 0) ## False negative rate- Black ## Out of those who recidivate, how often does it predict not recidivate? fnrate.black &lt;-sum(black$cvpredictions== 0 &amp; black$two_year_recid == 1) / sum(black$two_year_recid == 1) ## False positive rate- white fprate.white &lt;- sum(white$cvpredictions == 1 &amp; white$two_year_recid == 0) / sum(white$two_year_recid == 0) ## False negative rate- white fnrate.white &lt;-sum(white$cvpredictions== 0 &amp; white$two_year_recid == 1) / sum(white$two_year_recid == 1) Let’s see how our predictions perform across racial groups ## False positive rates fprate.black ## [1] 0.2846797 fprate.white ## [1] 0.1323925 ## False negative rates fnrate.black ## [1] 0.3734876 fnrate.white ## [1] 0.6076605 We see asymmetries in the types of errors the model is making across racial groups. Black subjects have higher false positives– more likely as being predicted to recidivate (a predicted “positive”) when they do not (the “false” in false positive). White subjects have higher false negatives– predicted not to recidivate (the negative) when they do (the false in false negative). Based on these results, reflect on the following: Should we use this type of algorithm in public policy? What might be desirable about this process over alternatives? What are possible concerns? Does your answer depend on accuracy or other considerations? What should we care more about? False positives or false negatives? What measures of fairness should be considered? Are there ways to avoid an unfair/biased model? 9.2.1 Extended Learning Note: There are many debates about the use of these algorithms Example of Initial Critique from ProPublica Example of Rejoinder Discussion of what fairness means: J. Kleinberg, S. Mullainathan, M. Raghavan, Inherent trade-offs in the fair determination of risk scores. (2016). Notes that goals of fairness can be in competition: Well-calibrated: if the algorithm identifies a set of people as having a probability z of constituting positive instances, then approximately a z fraction of this set should indeed be positive instances Balance for positive and negative instances across groups: the chance of making a mistake on should not depend on which group they belong to.

"],["hypothesis-testing-overview-of-process.html", "10.1 Hypothesis Testing Overview of Process", " 10.1 Hypothesis Testing Overview of Process Process for Hypothesis Testing Start with a research question: Are job applicants with criminal records less likely to receive call backs for interviews than applicants without criminal records? Develop a theory of how the world works E.g., “Job prospects are, in part, a function of someone’s criminal record.” Construct “null” and “alternative” hypotheses E.g., \\(H_o\\): “Applicants with a criminal record will receive call backs at similar rates as those without a criminal record” (I.e., no difference) E.g., \\(H_A\\): “Applicants with a criminal record will be less likely to receive call backs than those without a criminal record” or “Applicants with a criminal record will receive call backs at different rates than those without a criminal record” (I.e., some nonzero difference) Example of Implied Framework Health Savings Experiment (Dupas and Robinson 2013): Researchers conducted a field experiment in rural Kenya in which they randomly varied access to four innovative saving technologies and observed the impact on asset accumulation. Participants who were given a box locked with a padlock and key saved about 150 Kenyan Shillings more after 12 months relative to those who were simply encouraged to save money for health. Did the lock box work? What are the implied null and alternative hypotheses? Process for Hypothesis Testing Carry out a test of the hypothesis, such as a difference-in-means. Applicants with a criminal record receive 12.5 percentage points fewer call backs than those without a criminal record Calculate the uncertainty around this estimate. Decide whether you can reject or fail to reject the hypothesis of no difference "],["sampling-and-uncertainty.html", "10.2 Sampling and Uncertainty", " 10.2 Sampling and Uncertainty Flip a coin 10 times here. Report how many times it lands on heads. Imagine repeating this process over and over again. We know that a fair coin should land on heads 50% of the time- 5 out of 10 times or 50 out of 100 times. However, in any given sample of coin flips, you might get a slightly different result. If you repeated the sample a bunch of times, sometimes you might get 4 heads, 5 heads, 6 heads, 3 heads, etc. This does not mean the coin is unfair. Instead, just due to chance, we ended up with 6 out of 10 heads in a world where the true proportion of times that coin would land on heads is .5. How much evidence would we need to reject the idea that the coin is unfair? What if we got 90 heads out of 100 coin flips? Would that be enough to make us skeptical of the coin? This is the idea of null hypothesis testing. We gather evidence and make a judgment about whether we can reject a null hypothesis. How likely would it be that by chance we could flip 90 heads in a world where that coin was actually fair? For example, when we find a relationship between two variables (e.g., a correlation, a difference-in-means, a regression coefficient), this could be due to chance in a single sample. When we conduct an experiment and find that applicants with a criminal record were called back 12.5 percentage points less often than those without a criminal record, we want to know… Is that a real difference, or is the real difference 0, and we just happened to get our 12.5-point difference in our sample due to chance? In statistical hypothesis testing, what we will try to do is quantify how likely it is that we could observe a difference as big as 12.5 in a given sample if, in fact, the real difference is 0. We want to be able to make a judgment about how likely the relationship we observed in a sample of applications/hiring decisions could exist in a world where criminal records really have no impact on job prospects. We are going to use this example help us break down a few concepts. 10.2.1 Sampling Distribution The number of heads you generate over repeated samples is the “sampling distribution.” The higher the curve, the more likely we would observe that number of heads. For example, if you flip a coin 100 times, it is likely you will get close to 50 heads (50%), and very unlikely you will flip more than 80 heads (80% heads). So if you flip a coin and get 55 heads, we might still think the coin is fair, but once you start moving to the tails of this curve . . . It is highly unlikely we could flip a coin 100 times and get 80 heads just by random chance i.e., if the coin were fair. The “bell” shape of this distribution isn’t an anomaly. The “Central Limit Theorem” tells us that over repeated samples (so long as your sample is sufficiently large), the distribution of “means” will be normal This is incredibly important because we know a lot about normal distributions, such as that 95% of the sample mean estimates fall within two (technically: 1.96) standard errors of the mean. Only if we observe a number of heads outside those lines would we think perhaps it is not a fair coin. Let’s now imagine our study on criminal records and job prospects. In a world where the true difference in call back rates between those with and without criminal records is 0, in any given sample, we might end up with a 3 percentage point difference, -5 percentage point difference, 2 point difference, -1 point difference, and so on. The shape of the bell curve would be centered on 0 difference (Central Limit Theorem), meaning on average, over repeated samples of applicants/hiring decisions, there would be 0 difference, but occasionally we would still find some differences across samples. What we want to know is if a 12.5 point difference is within two standard errors of 0 or if it is pretty unusual. (Is it more like 55 heads or 80 heads?) 10.2.1.1 Details: Standard Errors A standard error is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution Where a standard deviation is the typical distance between a given observation and the mean. Compare the two photos below showing 0 standard deviation vs. a large standard deviation From the Cartoon Guide to Statistics In real life studies, we don’t know the actual sampling distribution because we only have 1 sample (we only had one study of applications/hiring decisions). So we estimate our standard error using the standard deviation of our sample (\\(S\\)) and sample size (\\(N\\)). \\({\\hat {SE}} = \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{N}}\\) The bigger the sample, the SMALLER the standard error (which is good) because it means less uncertainty.

We will estimate the standard error of the estimate using the sample size and sample spread (standard deviation) We can also estimate the confidence intervals Decide whether you can reject or fail to reject the hypothesis of no difference Standarize the estimate and find the z-score (or t-statistic, which is similar) The z score is an example of a “test statistic.” The type of statistic might vary across applications, but its purpose will remain similar. Others include t-statistics and Chi-squared statistics. How likely is it you would observe the z-score you found under this null distribution? (p-value) If the p-value is small (\\(&lt; 0.05\\)), reject the null. A z-score helps us standardize the size of estimates across any units of study by quantifying the size of the estimate in terms of standard errors. z-score = \\(\\frac{\\text{Estimate - Null}}{\\hat{SE}} = \\frac{\\text{Estimate - 0}}{\\hat{SE}}\\) The z-score represents the number of standard errors away that the estimate is from the null. We can visualize the distribution of z-scores in the image below. The bell curve is centered on 0 and represents our null distribution. The z-score represents how many standard errors away our estimate is from the null. Instead of the axis being the number of heads out of 100 coin flips, centered on the null hypothesis of 50 heads for a fair coin, the standardized scale is centered on 0. We can then visualize how far 80 coin flips is away from 50 by measuring how many standard errors 80 is away from the null of 50. Recall, we asked: When we conduct an experiment and find that applicants with a criminal record were called back 12.5 percentage points less often than those without a criminal record, we want to know… Is that a real difference, or is the real difference 0, and we just happened to get our 12.5-point difference in our sample due to random chance? It so happens that our 12.5 percentage difference represents more than z=7 standard errors away from the null of z=0 difference. We can visualize where z=7 is in our distribution below with the dashed purple line: It is well outside of the red lines representing 1.96 standard errors. Interpretation: It is really unlikely we would have observed this extreme in magnitude of difference if the true difference were 0. This likelihood represents the p-value, which is essentially 0 in this case. There is essentially 0 chance we would have observed a difference as large or larger than 12.5 (or -12.5) in a world where the true difference is 0. If a p-value is &lt; 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. If instead, the p-value is larger than 0.05, we fail to reject the null. That would mean that we think it is reasonably possible to have observed a difference as big as 12.5 if in fact the true difference is 0. We are going to focus on two-sided p-values, which focus on the magnitude of the z-score in either direction, instead of whether it is a positive or negative p-value. In other classes, you may also cover one-sided p-values. 10.3.1 Relationship to Confidence Intervals Relationship to Confidence Intervals: Our 12.5 percentage difference has a 95% confidence interval of 6.8 to 18.3 It is constructed by taking \\(12.5 - 1.96*SE\\) and \\(12.5 + 1.96*SE\\) This means there is a 95% chance that this interval contains the true population difference. It gives us another way of describing our estimate that includes our uncertainty. We recognize that over repeated samples, we are not always going to get a 12.5 point difference. In any given sample, this estimate will differ a bit over the “sampling distribution.” "],["wrapping-up-the-process.html", "10.4 Wrapping up the Process", " 10.4 Wrapping up the Process Let’s Review the Process Start with a research question: Are job applicants with criminal records less likely to receive call backs for interviews than applicants without criminal records? Develop a theory of how the world works E.g., “Job prospects are, in part, a function of someone’s criminal record.” Construct “null” and “alternative” hypotheses E.g., \\(H_o\\): “Applicants with a criminal record will receive call backs at similar rates as those without a criminal record” (I.e., no difference) E.g., \\(H_A\\): “Applicants with a criminal record will be less likely to receive call backs than those without a criminal record” or “Applicants with a criminal record will receive call backs at different rates than those without a criminal record” (I.e., some nonzero difference) Carry out a test of the hypothesis, such as a difference-in-means. Applicants with a criminal record receive 12.5 percentage points fewer call backs than those without a criminal record Calculate the uncertainty around this estimate. We could estimate the standard error with the sample standard deviation and sample size We could also estimate the confidence intervals. Decide whether the result is significant. Can you reject or do you fail to reject the hypothesis of no difference? Use the z-score/t-statistic and p-value The z score is an example of a “test statistic.” The type of statistic might vary across applications, but its purpose will remain similar.

We say something is significant if the p-value is small, such as less than 0.05. We also use this criteria to assess if we should reject the null hypothesis. In a “t test”, the t-statistic serves as the z-score. It counts the number of standard errors away from the null. The t-statistic and z-scores differ slightly in how we calculate the corresponding p-value, but with a large enough sample size, these are also very similar. The t.test function in R calculates the p-value for you. "],["additional-applications.html", "10.6 Additional Applications", " 10.6 Additional Applications We will carry out the same type of hypothesis testing process for a range of different scenarios. Though the process will remain very similar, the underlying statistical test/calculation/R function will change. If dependent variable is numeric / continuous, can use regression and lm() (type of independent variable does not matter) If dependent variable is numeric and want to compare between two specific groups, can use t.test() If dependent variable is binary, such as assessing the proportion of call back rates, and want to compare between two specific groups, can use prop.test() Other tests exist for different situations 10.6.1 Example Using Regression 1. Start with a research question Do past election results help explain future election results? 2. Develop a theory of how the world works A third-party candidate’s performance in one election will help us predict the success of a future third-party candidate. 3. Construct “null” and “alternative” hypotheses and 4. Carry out a test of the hypothesis, such as a regression. In a regression, our key hypothesis test is about whether there is a significant, non-zero relationship between an independent variable and the outcome. The null hypothesis is that \\(\\beta = 0\\). The alternative is that \\(\\beta \\neq 0\\). Going back to our Florida example: The null hypothesis would be the 1996 Perot vote does not help us explain the Buchanan 2000 vote (that \\(\\beta = 0\\)). Our alternative is \\(\\beta \\neq 0\\), that there is some relationship between 1996 Perot votes and the 2000 Buchanan vote in Florida counties. florida &lt;- read.csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ktmccabe/teachingdata/main/florida.csv&quot;) We estimate \\(\\hat \\beta\\): for every 1 additional vote Perot received in 1996, we expect Buchanan to receive .036 additional votes in 2000. fit &lt;- lm(Buchanan00 ~ Perot96, data = florida) coef(fit) ## (Intercept) Perot96 ## 1.34575212 0.03591504 Is that relationship significant? In other words, is it helpful to know the Perot 1996 vote to help explain the Buchanan 2000 vote? Or should we treat the 0.036 number as essentially 0, just noise? Recall that the \\(\\hat \\beta\\) represents the estimated slope of the relationship. We ask: Is that relationship (the slope) significant (i.e., statistically different from 0 slope)? 5. Calculate the uncertainty around this estimate. Our regression lm function will also generate estimates of uncertainty related to hypothesis testing round(summary(fit)$coefficients, digits=4) ## Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|) ## (Intercept) 1.3458 49.7593 0.0270 0.9785 ## Perot96 0.0359 0.0043 8.2752 0.0000 6. Decide whether you can reject or fail to reject the hypothesis of no difference We see the p-value for Perot96 is essentially 0– well less than 0.05. Therefore, it is highly unlikely we would observe a slope as big or bigger (in magnitude) as 0.0359 if Perot96 and Buchanan00 were actually unrelated. We consider the effect “statistically significant.” We reject a null hypothesis that the Perot 1996 vote is unrelated to the Buchanan 2000 vote. In social science papers, regressions are often presented in tables: ## ## ======================= ## Model 1 ## ----------------------- ## (Intercept) 1.35 ## (49.76) ## Perot96 0.04 *** ## (0.00) ## ----------------------- ## R^2 0.51 ## Adj.

Experimental Example: Going Back to Resume and Race study 1. Start with a research question Does race influence hiring decisions? 2. Develop a theory of how the world works Theory: Black applicants face discrimination in hiring. 3. Construct “null” and “alternative” hypotheses We can conduct a two-sided hypothesis test \\(H_o\\): No difference in call back rates for Black and white applicants \\(H_a\\): Some difference in call back rates for Black and white applicants The two-sided means we aren’t specifying a direction of our alternative hypothesis. Instead, we are conducting test just trying to reject the idea of no difference between racial groups. Sometimes researchers may specify the alternative hypothesis in a directional way, such as Black applicants will have a lower call back rate than white applicants. However, it is more common to use a two-sided test, even if researchers have a theoretical hypothesis in a particular direction. resume &lt;- read.csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ktmccabe/teachingdata/main/resume.csv&quot;) head(resume) ## firstname sex race call ## 1 Allison female white 0 ## 2 Kristen female white 0 ## 3 Lakisha female black 0 ## 4 Latonya female black 0 ## 5 Carrie female white 0 ## 6 Jay male white 0 4.

"],["application-programming-interfaces.html", "11.6 Application Programming Interfaces", " 11.6 Application Programming Interfaces Application programming interfaces (APIs) are tools that allow you to search a large database to extract specific types of information. Social scientists often work with APIs to extract data from social media platforms, government agencies (e.g., U.S. Census), and news sites, among others. Organizations that develop these APIs can control what types of information researchers can access. Often, they set limits on the types and quantities of information someone can collect. Companies also often monitor who accesses the information by requiring people to sign up for access, apply for access, and/or pay for access. Example: Census API As an example of an API, the U.S. Census has an API that allows researchers to extract nicely formatted data summaries of different geographic units (e.g., all zip codes in the U.S.). Researchers can sign up here for an API “key” which allows the organization to monitor who is accessing what information. Researchers Kyle Walker and Matt Herman have made an R package that makes working with the API easier. Example: tidycensus found here allows you to search Census data by providing the variables you want to extract APIs can make a social scientist’s life easier by providing an efficient way to collect data. Without an API, researchers might have to resort to manually extracting information from online or writing an ad hoc set of code to “scrape” the information off of websites. This can be time consuming, against an organization or company’s policy, or even impossible in some cases. APIs are powerful and efficient. However, because researchers cannot control the API, the downside is at any given time, an organization could change or remove API access. Researchers might also not have the full details of what information is included in the API, potentially leading to biased conclusions from the data. APIs are great, but we should use them with caution. Because the APIs require you to sign up for access (giving away your information), this course will not require that you gain access or use the APIs 11.6.1 Twitter API v1 Let’s try an example working with a Twitter API. To use this version of the Twitter API with R, you need To create a Twitter account (you don’t need to tweet from the account, just need an account) An internet connection To install the rtweet package install.packages(&quot;rtweet&quot;) Let’s open the package library(rtweet) The API sets guidelines about what and how much information a person can collect from Twitter over a particular duration of time. With the version of the API we are working with, we can collect a few thousand of the most recent tweets of any public user and search recent tweets (past few days) on Twitter that include keywords. Twitter has other versions of the API that academic researchers can apply to for broader access, including access to older tweets (e.g., if you wanted to study tweets during the 2020 election). Researchers have developed a separate R package for working with this broader API. 11.6.1.1 Searching tweets for keywords. The first time you use a function from rtweet, R will prompt you to authenticate and authorize an “app” through your Twitter account. Essentially, a web browser on your computer should automatically open to a Twitter landing page asking you to hit the “authorize” button. Once you do this, then you should be able to return to R and work with the R functions. (This is why you need a Twitter account and an internet connection to work with this package.) We can use the search_tweets function to search recent tweets that contain keywords. We can specify the number of tweets to extract with the n argument. We can also filter tweets with additional arguments, such as by limiting tweets to English tweets or omitting retweets. ## simple keyword search taylortweets &lt;-search_tweets(&quot;taylorsversion&quot;, n=1000) ## use &#39; &#39; to search for exact phrase simmonstweets &lt;-search_tweets(&#39;&quot;ben simmons&quot;&#39;, n=1000) ## use OR between words to search for tweets with at least one of the key words f1tweets &lt;- search_tweets(&#39;&quot;daniel ricciardo&quot; OR &quot;lando norris&quot;&#39;, n=500) ## just keep a space between words, no extra quotes to search for tweets that include both words somewhere bachtweets &lt;- search_tweets(&quot;bachelorette michelle&quot;, n=400) ## limit tweets to include only english tweets coronatweets &lt;- search_tweets(&quot;coronavirus OR COVID&quot;, n=200, lang = &quot;en&quot;) ## omit retweets, may affect total n extracted rittenhousetweets &lt;- search_tweets(&quot;rittenhouse&quot;, n=200, include_rts = FALSE) The resulting object we created with the first search, taylortweets, is a dataframe and includes the 1000 tweets we requested to extract along with 90 variables of information about those tweets. A few notable variables: screen_name: the screen name of the twitter user text: the text of the tweet is_retweet: an indiactor TRUE or FALSE indicating if the tweet was a retweet favorite_count: the number of times the tweet was favorited (liked) followers_count: number of followers the user has friends_count: number of users that the tweeter follows statuses_count: the number of tweets from the user verified: an indicator TRUE or FALSE indicating if the user is verified lang: language of the tweet 11.6.1.2 Extracting user timeline Here is an example of extracting tweets from a particular user. You cane extract up to 3200 recent tweets of a specified public user. If you try to extract tweets from several users at once, you might hit a “rate limit” indicating that you requested more information than allowed over a particular period of time. ## extracting tweets from potus bidentweets &lt;- get_timeline(&quot;potus&quot;, n=3200) ## extracting tweets from potus polleaders &lt;- c(&quot;potus&quot;, &quot;vp&quot;) poltweets &lt;- get_timeline(polleaders, n=3200) Similar to the keyword tweets, the object created will provide the text of the tweets and information about the reactions to the tweets. 11.6.2 Saving R Objects After you extract an tweets from online, you may want to save them as a hard data file on your computer. This way if you close RStudio, you can recover the tweets without needing to extract new tweets from Twitter. R allows you to save any R object as an .RData file that can be opened with the load() command. This is discussed on pg. 24 of QSS Chapter 1. We can demonstrate this now by saving taylortweets as an RData object. It will automatically save to your working directory, but you can also add a subfolder or alternative file path. save(taylortweets, file = &quot;taylortweets.RData&quot;) Prior to saving the file, you could consider limiting the number of variables you want to save if you didn’t want to store 90 variables. Example of keeping only 5 variables: taylortweets &lt;- taylortweets[, c(&quot;user_id&quot;, &quot;screen_name&quot;, &quot;text&quot;, &quot;created_at&quot;, &quot;is_retweet&quot;)] save(taylortweets, file = &quot;taylortweets.RData&quot;) Then, you can load the file (if you happen to close R/RStudio, restart your computer, etc.) with the load command. load(&quot;taylortweets.RData&quot;) "],["application-sentiment-analysis.html", "11.7 Application: Sentiment Analysis", " 11.7 Application: Sentiment Analysis In this example we will conduct a sentiment analysis of tweets extracted through the Twitter API. You can use dataset provided on Canvas or extract your own tweets To extract your own, you need a Twitter account and rtweet installed. Using tweets in political science? Research on Twitter is actually pretty common in the social sciences, including political science. Part of the reason for this is the access Twitter provides via API, which makes it an easier platform to study. Below are some examples of uses of Twitter data in social science research. Scholars are often interested in characterizing the tone, such as incivility or toxicity, in online political discussions. They may also use Twitter as a mechanism to study interactions between the public and elected officials and other public figures, as well as studying how politicians use Twitter as a form of strategic communication. Political communications scholars have studied the extent to which journalists use Twitter to interpret public opinion, as well as study how media can control and set the agenda of what people discuss on Twitter. When doing political science research on Twitter, we should be careful about how we generalize the results to other settings. There is some evidence from Bor and Peterson that those who demonstrate incivility in offline discussions carry that behavior to online settings, there are other ways that someone’s behavior on Twitter will not match their behavior in other settings or represent their underlying throughts or beliefs. For a video explainer of the code in this section, see below. (Via youtube, you can speed up the playback to 1.5 or 2x speed.) For this example, we need the rtweet and syuzhet packages. install.packages(&quot;rtweet&quot;) # for extracting tweets install.packages(&quot;syuzhet&quot;) # for late sentiment analysis In R, we open the packages with library(). library(rtweet) library(syuzhet) 11.7.1 Searching tweets for keywords We will first search recent tweets for keywords. The first time you use the package, it will open up an authentication browser asking you to “authorize” the Twitter app. This is giving you access to the API. See the details above in the course notes for the syntax of this function. politicstweets &lt;- search_tweets(&quot;political OR partisan&quot;, n=2000) thanksgivingtweets &lt;- search_tweets(&quot;thanksgiving&quot;, n=2000) After you create the tweets, you can save them as an RData file on your computer so that you don’t lose them when you close R. save(politicstweets, file=&quot;politicstweets.RData&quot;) save(thanksgivingtweets, file=&quot;thanksgivingtweets.RData&quot;) These can then be loaded back into R at anytime. load(&quot;data/politicstweets.RData&quot;) load(&quot;data/thanksgivingtweets.RData&quot;) load(&quot;politicstweets.RData&quot;) load(&quot;thanksgivingtweets.RData&quot;) 11.7.2 Sentiment Analysis Overview Oftentimes, beyond characterizing the length or topic of a set of text, we might want to know the tone of the text. There are many ways to measure tone or “sentiment.” One approach extends what we did with dictionary analysis. Researchers have developed dictionaries of words that are typically associated with positive or negative sentiment. We will use the bing dictionary. Sometimes, researchers go so far as to create dictionaries for discrete emotions (e.g., happiness) or other types of measures, such as toxicity levels or hate speech. Using these pre-existing dictionaries, we can then count how many words in a body of text have positive vs. negative tone to summarize the sentiment of a document. Like any dictionary analysis, there are limitations to this “bag of words” approach– looking at the words individually without considering the context in which they are mentioned. 11.7.3 Implementing sentiment analysis The get_sentiment() function will calculate the net positive - negative score of a piece of text according to a specified dictionary. We can store this as a new variable. politicstweets$sentiment &lt;- get_sentiment(politicstweets$text, method=&quot;bing&quot;) thanksgivingtweets$sentiment &lt;- get_sentiment(thanksgivingtweets$text, method=&quot;bing&quot;) ## Example output politicstweets$sentiment[1:10] ## [1] -2 -3 4 1 -7 -2 -3 -3 -4 0 Let’s compare the sentiment of these sets of tweets to help answer the question: Should we talk about politics at Thanksgiving dinner? We add a plotting concept: Plotting multiple plots. ## Set par par(mfrow = c(1, 2)) # 1 row with 2 plots ## Plot just the first object hist(politicstweets$sentiment, xlab=&quot;Sentiment (bing score)&quot;, main=&quot;Sentiment Scores for Politics Tweets&quot;, cex.main=.7, ylim = c(0, 800), xlim = c(-8, 8), border= F) ## Add lines for the mean sentiment abline(v=mean(politicstweets$sentiment), lwd=2) ## Second plot hist(thanksgivingtweets$sentiment, xlab=&quot;Sentiment (bing score)&quot;, main=&quot;Sentiment Scores for Thanksgiving Tweets&quot;, cex.main = .7, col=&quot;pink&quot;, ylim = c(0, 800), xlim = c(-8, 8), border= F) abline(v=mean(thanksgivingtweets$sentiment), lwd=2) 11.7.4 Your Twitter Analysis As mentioned above We can also search the most recent 3200 tweets of a given user. Here we extract tweets from AOC’s Twitter account aoctweets &lt;- get_timeline(&quot;aoc&quot;, n=3200) As a challenge, conduct your own analysis of the congresswoman’s tweets. It could be a sentiment analysis, or you could use one or more tools from the previous sections on text analysis.

See this discussion from Kieran Healy in Chap. 7: Each of these maps shows data for the same event, but the impressions they convey are very different … Often, a map is like a weird grid that you are forced to conform to even though you know it systematically misrepresents what you want to show.” Healy Chapter 7 "],["mapping-in-r.html", "12.2 Mapping in R", " 12.2 Mapping in R Install maps package.

While the plotting tools we have worked with before can do this, the function ggplot has a better interface that will more easily help us avoid mistakes, such as putting a label in the wrong place. install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) Open the packages each time you want to use them. library(ggplot2) The “gg” stands for “grammar of graphics.” The ggplot2 package has a very general function ggplot() that provides another system of visualizing data in R. It can be used to plot all kinds of visuals, including scatterplots, barplots, histograms, etc. We are going to focus on its utility for plotting maps, as many new developments in mapping and GIS (geographic information systems) in R use this interface. In ggplot() you add layers to a plot by using + between lines While ggplot() can be applied very widely, we will focus on a more narrow set of applications for mapping. We will create a map of New Jersey. Similar to before, we will first use a function to pull up map data about U.S. states.

Note that subregion is the name of the county variable in the first dataframe (the x) and county is the name of the county variable in the second dataframe (the y).

Why might mapping visualizations and spatial data be useful to political scientists for these questions? 12.7.1 Adding points to a map In this application, we use the Global Terrorism Database to visualize where terrorist attacks (including failed attacks) have occurred in recent years in France.

The author maps which group is in control of different communities in 2014 and 2015, including: opposition forces, Islamic State forces, government forces, and Kurdish forces. Among other findings, the author shows that group presence influences the degree of targeted repressive violence. We are going to map the territorial control of Syria at these two time points using the author’s data. Note: the mapping data we use does not come directly from the maps package. Instead the author used “shape files” from an external source, which then can be converted into a dataframe like we get when using map_data. Let’s load the data.

Below are some tips for working with new data. "],["get-to-know-new-data.html", "13.1 Get to know new data", " 13.1 Get to know new data How to explore new data When you encounter a new dataset, try to also identify the codebook that goes along with it. This should have information describing what the variables are in the data and what the values mean. It should also help clarify what unit is in each row of a dataset (e.g., is each row a survey respondent, an election, a Member of Congress, a country in a particular year) When you download data, identify the file type (e.g., .csv, .dta, .RData) Recall that chapter 1 of QSS section 1.3.5 (pg. 20) goes over how to read in different file types in R with functions like read.csv, read.dta with the library(foreign) package, etc. When you load in the data in RStudio, explore it. How many rows? nrow, How many columns? ncol You can View() the data or look at the first few rows with head() Are most variables numeric? Or, does it seem like you have factor and character variables? See if the data seem to match up with what the codebook suggests should be there. How to investigate new variables Real-world data may often require some cleaning or “wrangling” So you have some data…. AND it’s a mess!!! A lot of the data we may encounter in courses has been simplified to allow students to focus on other concepts. We may have data that look like the following: nicedata &lt;- data.frame(gender = c(&quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;), age = c(16, 20, 66, 44), voterturnout = c(1, 0, 1, 0)) gender age voterturnout Male 16 1 Female 20 0 Female 66 1 Male 44 0 In the real world, our data may hit us like a ton of bricks, like the below: uglydata &lt;- data.frame(VV160002 = c(2, NA, 1, 2), VV1400068 = c(16, 20, 66, 44), VV20000 = c(1, NA, 1, NA)) VV160002 VV1400068 VV20000 2 16 1 NA 20 NA 1 66 1 2 44 NA A lot of common datasets we use in the social sciences are messy, uninformative, sprawling, misshaped, and/or incomplete. What do I mean by this? The data might have a lot of missing values. For example, we may have NA values in R, or perhaps a research firm has used some other notation for missing data, such as a 99. The variable names may be uninformative. For example, there may be no way to know by looking at the data, which variable represents gender. We have to look at a codebook. Even if we can tell what a variable is, its categories may not be coded in a way that aligns with how we want to use the data for our research question. For example, perhaps you are interested in the effect of a policy on people below vs. 65 and over in age. Well, your age variables might just be a numeric variable. You will have to create a new variable that aligns with your theoretical interest. Datasets are often sprawling. Some datasets may have more than 1000 variables. It is hard to sort through all of them. Likewise, datasets may have millions of observations. We cannot practically look through all the values of a column to know what is there. 13.1.1 Dealing with Uninformative Variable Names Hopefully, there is an easy fix for dealing with uninformative variable names. I say “hopefully” because hopefully when you encounter a dataset with uninformative variable names, the place where you downloaded the data will also include a codebook telling you what each variable name means, and how the corresponding values are coded. Unfortunately, this may not always be the case. One thing you can do as a researcher is when you create a dataset for your own work, keep a record (in written form, on a word document or in a pdf or code file) of what each variable means (e.g., the survey question it corresponds to or the exact economic measure), as well as how the values of the variables are coded. This good practice will help you in the short-term, as you pause and come back to working on a project over the course of a year, as well as benefit other researchers in the long run after you publish your research. For examples of large codebooks, you can view the 2016 American National Election Study Survey and click on a codebook. I recommend that once you locate the definition of a variable of interest, rename the variable in your dataset to be informative. You can do this by creating a new variable or overwriting the name of the existing variable. You might also comment a note for yourself of what the values mean. ## Option 1: create new variable ## gender 2=Male, 1=Female uglydata$gender &lt;- uglydata$VV160002 ## Option 2: Overwrite names(uglydata)[1] &lt;- &quot;gender2&quot; 13.1.2 Dealing with Missing Data When we have a column with missing data, it is best to do a few things: Try to quantify how much missing data there is and poke at the reason why data are missing. Is it minor non-response data? Or is it indicative of a more systematic issue? For example, maybe data from a whole group of people or countries is missing for certain variables. If the data are missing at a very minor rate and/or there is a logical explanation for the missing data that should not affect your research question, you may choose to “ignore” the missing data when performing common analyses, such as taking the mean or running a regression. If we want to figure out how much missing data we have in a variable, we have a couple of approaches: ## Summarize this variable summary(uglydata$gender) ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. NA&#39;s ## 1.000 1.500 2.000 1.667 2.000 2.000 1 ## What is the length of the subset of the variable where the data are missing length(uglydata$gender[is.na(uglydata$gender) == T]) ## [1] 1 If we choose to ignore missing data, this can often be easily accomplished in common operations. For example, when taking the mean we just add an argument na.rm = T: mean(uglydata$VV1400068, na.rm=T) ## [1] 36.5 We should always be careful with missing data to understand how R is treating it in a particular scenario. 13.1.3 Dealing with Variable Codings that Aren’t Quite Right Often times the ways that variables are coded in datasets we get off-the-shelf are not coded exactly as how we were dreaming up operationalizing our concepts. Instead, we are going to have to wrangle the data to get them into shape. This may involve creating new variables that recode certain values, creating new variables that collapse some values into a smaller number of categories, combining multiple variables into a single variable (e.g., representing the average), or setting some of the variable values to be missing (NA). All of these scenarios may come up when you are dealing with real data. ## create variable indicating over 65 vs. under 65 ## approach 1 uglydata$over65 &lt;- NA uglydata$over65[uglydata$VV1400068 &gt;=65] &lt;- 1 uglydata$over65[uglydata$VV1400068 &lt; 65] &lt;- 0 ## approach 2 uglydata$over65 &lt;- ifelse(uglydata$VV1400068 &gt;=65, 1, 0) 13.1.4 Dealing with Parts of Datasets We may also want to limit our analysis to just small parts of datasets instead of the entire dataset. Recall the function subset to limit the data to only rows that meet certain criteria. ## limit data to those over 65 over65 &lt;- subset(uglydata, over65 == 1) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
