## What have I signed up for?


First: What is Data Science?

  - Data Science involves a combination of math/statistics and programming/coding skills, which, for our purposes, we will combine with social science knowledge.
    + [Drew Conway](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram) has a nice venn diagram of how these different skill sets intersect.
    + Note: This course will not assume prior familiarity with data science in general or coding, specifically. For those brand new to data science, the idea of learning to code may seem intimidating, but anyone can succeed with a bit of patience and an open mind.

![](images/venn.png)
  
Next: What is political science?
  
  - The science of politics, of course! Politics focuses on studying governance and the distribution of power in society, broadly conceived. 
      + How else might you define politics and political science? What do we study in political science?


### Data Science Can Help Social Scientists


***Example: Mapping poverty using mobile phone and satellite data***

Researchers used modern data sources, including mobile phone data, as a way to ***predict*** and ***describe*** poverty in different geographic regions. These tools helped social scientists come up with methods that are much more cost-effective and efficient, but still as accurate as traditional methods for this type of measurement.

  - How might measures of global poverty be useful to political scientists?


![](images/blum.jpg){width=90%}

*[Steele et al. 2017](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsif.2016.0690): Poverty is one of the most important determinants of adverse health outcomes globally, a major cause of societal instability and one of the largest causes of lost human potential. Traditional approaches to measuring and targeting poverty rely heavily on census data, which in most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are unavailable or out-of-date. Alternate measures are needed to complement and update estimates between censuses. This study demonstrates how public and private data sources that are commonly available for LMICs can be used to provide novel insight into the spatial distribution of poverty.* 


***Social Science Goals***

We have several goals in social science. Here are four that data science can help us pursue:

  - **Describe** and measure
      + Has the U.S. population increased?
  - **Explain**, evaluate, and recommend (study of causation)
      + Does expanding Medicaid improve health outcomes?
  - **Predict**
      + Who will win the next election?
  - **Discover**
      + How do policies diffuse across states?

What are other examples of these goals?



Note: In this course, we are exploiting the benefits of quantitative data to help achieve goals of social science. However, quantitative data have their shortcomings, too. We will also discuss the limitations of various applications of social science data, and we encourage you to always think critically about how we are using data.

### Course Goals

This course will provide you with a taste of each of these social science goals, and how the use of data can help achieve these goals. By the end of the course, you should be able to

  - Provide examples of how quantitative data may be used to help answer social science research questions.
  - Compare and contrast the goals of description, causation, prediction, and discovery in social science research.
  - Use the programming language R to import and explore social science data and conduct basic statistical analyses.
  - Interpret and describe visual displays of social science data, such as graphs and maps. 
  - Develop your own analyses and visualizations to understand social science phenomena.


If you are someone that loves data, we hope you will find this course engaging. If you are someone who loathes or finds the idea of working with data and statistics alarming, we hope you keep an open mind. We will meet you where you are. This course will not assume knowledge of statistical software, and there will be plenty of opportunities to ask questions and seek help from classmates and the instructor throughout the semester. 

The first section of course will walk people through how to use the statistical program-- R-- that we will employ this semester. 

***Will this course help me in the future?***

Even if you do not plan on becoming a social scientist or a data scientist, an introduction to these skills may prove helpful throughout your academic and professional careers.

  - To become an informed consumer of news articles and research involving quantitative analyses.
  - To practice analytical thinking to make informed arguments and decisions.
  - To expand your toolkit for getting a job that may involve consuming or performing some data analysis, even if that is not the traditional role.

## Setup in R {#rsetup}

**Goal**

By the end of the first week of the course, you will want to have R and RStudio installed on your computer (both free) and feel comfortable using R as a calculator.

R is an application that processes the R programming language in a statistical computing environment. RStudio is also an application, which serves as a user interface that makes working in R easier. We will primarily open and use RStudio to work with R.   

In other classes, you may come across Stata, SPSS, Excel, or SAS, which are programs that also conduct data analysis. R has the advantage of being free and open-source. Even after you leave the university setting, you will be able to use R/RStudio for free. As an open-source program, it is very flexible, and a community of active R/RStudio users is constantly adding to and improving the program.   


**R and RStudio Installation**

This content follows and reinforces QSS 1.3. Additional resources are also linked below.

  - This [video](http://www.youtube.com/embed/ulIv0NiVTs4?rel=0) from Professor Christopher Bail explains why many social scientists use R and describes the R and RStudio installation process. This involves
    1. Going to [cran](https://cran.r-project.org/), select the link that matches your operating system, and
then follow the installation instructions, and 
    2. Visiting [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) and follow the download and installation instructions. R is the statistical software and programming language used for analysis. RStudio provides a convenient user interface for running R code. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library("vembedr")
library(knitr)

```


 

## First Time Working in R and RStudio

This next section provides a few notes on using R and RStudio now that you have installed it. In this section, we cover the following materials:

  - Using R as a calculator and assigning objects using `<-`
  - Setting your working directory and the `setwd()` function.
  - Creating and saving an R script

This section highlights important concepts from QSS chapter 1.

### Open RStudio

RStudio is an open-source and free program that greatly facilitates the use of R, especially for users new to programming. Once you have downloaded and installed R and RStudio, to work in R, all you need to do now is ***open RStudio*** (it will open R). It should look like this, though your version numbers will be different:

![](images/rconsole1.png)

**Note:** The first time you open RStudio, you likely only have the three windows above. We will want to create a fourth window by **opening an R script** to create the fourth window. 

  - To do this, in RStudio, click on File -> New -> R script in your computer's toolbar. This will open a blank document for text editing in the upper left of the RStudio window. We will return to this window in a moment.
      + You can alternatively click on the green + sign indicator in the top-left corner of the RStudio window, which should give you the option to create a new R script document.

Now you should have something that looks like this, similar to Figure 1.1. in QSS:

![](images/rconsole2.png)

  
  - The upper-left window has our script document that will contain code.
  - The lower-left window is the console. This will show the output of the code we run. We will also be able to type directly in the console.
  - The upper-right window shows the environment (and other tabs, such as the history of commands). When we load and store data in RStudio, we will see a summary of that in the environment.
  - The lower-right window will enable us to view plots and search help files, among other things.



### Using R as a Calculator

The *bottom left* window in your RStudio is the Console. You can type in this window to use R as a calculator or to try out commands. It will show the raw output of any commands you type. For example, we can try to use R as a calculator. Type the following in the Console (the bottom left window) and hit "enter" or "return" on your keyboard:

```{r}
5 + 3

5 - 3

5^2

5 * 3

5/3

(5 + 3) * 2
```

In the other RStudio windows, the upper right will show a history of commands that you have sent from the text editor to the R console, along with other items. The lower right will show graphs, help documents and other features. These will be useful later in the course.

### Working in an R Script

Earlier, I asked you to open an R script in the upper left window by doing File, then New File, then R Script. Let's go back to working in that window.

**Set your working directory `setwd()`**

(Almost) every time you work in RStudio, the first thing you will do is set your working directory. This is a designated folder in your computer where you will save your R scripts and datasets.

There are many ways to do this.

  - An easy way is to go to Session -> Set Working Directory -> Choose Directory. I suggest choosing a folder in your computer that you can easily find and that you will routinely use for this class. Go ahead and create/select it. 
  - Note: when you selected your directory, code came out in the bottom left Console window. This is the `setwd()` command which can also be used directly to set your working directory in the future.
  - If you aren't sure where your directory has been set, you can also type `getwd()` in your Console. Try it now


```{r, eval=F}
## Example of where my directory was
getwd()
```


If I want to  change the working directory, I can go to the top toolbar of my computer and use Session -> Set Working Directory -> Choose Directory or just type my file pathway using the `setwd()` below:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## Example of setting the working directory using setwd().
## Your computer will have your own file path.
setwd("/Users/ktmccabe/Dropbox/Rutgers Teaching/")
```


**Saving the R Script**

Let's now save our R script to our working directory and give it an informative name. To do so, go to File, then Save As, make sure you are in the same folder on your computer as the folder you chose for your working directory.

Give the file an informative name, such as: "McCabeWeek1.R". Note: all of your R scripts will have the .R extension.


### Preparing your R script

Now that we have saved our R script, let's work inside of it. Remember, we are in the top-left RStudio window now.

  - Just like the beginning of a paper, you will want to title your R script. In R, any line that you start with a \# will not be treated as a programming command. You can use this to your advantage to write titles/comments. Below is a screenshot example of a template R script.
  - You can specify your working directory at the top, too. Add your own filepath inside `setwd()`

![](images/templateR.png)


  - Then you can start answering problems in the rest of the script.
  - Think of the R script as where you write the final draft of your paper. In the Console (the bottom-left window), you can mess around and try different things, like you might when you are taking notes or outlining an essay. Then, write the final programming steps that lead you to your answer in the R script. For example, if I wanted to add 5 + 3, I might try different ways of typing it in the Console, and then when I found out `5 + 3` is the right approach, I would type that into my script.


### Executing Commands in your R script

The last thing we will note in this initial handout is how to execute commands in your R script.

To run / execute a command in your R script (the upper left window), you can

  1. Highlight the code you want to run, and then hold down "command + return" on a Mac or "control + enter" on Windows
  2. Place your cursor at the end of the line of code (far right), and hit "command + return" on a Mac or "control + return" on Windows, or
  3. Do 1 or 2, but instead of using the keyboard to execute the commands, click "Run" in the top right corner of the upper-left window.

Try it: Type `5 + 3` in the R script. Then, try to execute `5 + 3`. It should look something like this:


![](images/rtemplate2.png)

After you executed the code, you should see it pop out in your Console:
```{r}
5 + 3
```

![](images/runningcode.png){width=90%}

Note: The symbol \# also allows for annotation behind commands or on a separate line. Everything that follows \# will be ignored by R. You can annotate your own code so that you and others can understand what each part of the code is designed to do.

```{r}
## Example
sum53 <- 5 + 3 # example of assigning an addition calculation
```

### Objects

Sometimes we will want to store our calculations as "objects" in R. We use `<-` to assign objects by placing it [to the left](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZA67L7gIo&ab_channel=BeyonceSasha1) of what we want to store. For example, let's store the calculation `5 + 3` as an object named `sum53`:

```{r}
sum53 <- 5 + 3
```

After we execute this code, `sum53 now stores the calculation. This means, that if we execute a line of code that just has `sum53`, it will output 8. Try  it:

```{r}
sum53
```

Now we no longer have to type `5 + 3`, we can just type `sum53`. For example, let's say we wanted to subtract 2 from this calculation. We could do:

```{r}
sum53 - 2
```

Let's say we wanted to divide two stored calculations:
```{r}
ten <- 5 + 5
two <- 1 + 1
ten / two
```

The information stored does not have to be numeric. For example, it can be a word, or what we would call a character string, in which case you need to use quotation marks.

```{r}
mccabe <- "professor for this course"
mccabe
```


*Note:* Object names cannot begin with numbers and no spacing is allowed. Avoid using special characters such as \% and \$, which have specific meanings in R. Finally, use concise and intuitive object names.

  - GOOD CODE: `practice.calc <- 5 + 3`
  - BAD CODE: `meaningless.and.unnecessarily.long.name <- 5 + 3`

While these are simple examples, we will use objects all the time for more complicated things to store (e.g., like full datasets!) throughout the course.

We can also store an array or "vector" of information using `c()`

```{r}
somenumbers <- c(3, 6, 8, 9)
somenumbers
```

**Importance of Clean Code**

Ideally, when you are done with your R script, you should be able to highlight the entire script and execute it without generating any error messages. This means your code is clean. Code with typos in it may generate a red error message in the Console upon execution. This can happen when there are typos or commands are misused.

For example, R is case sensitive. Let's say we assigned our object like before:
```{r}
sum53 <- 5 + 3
```

However, when we went to execute `sum53`, we accidentally typed `Sum53`:
```{r, error=TRUE}
Sum53
```

Only certain types of objects can be used in mathematical calculations. Let's say we tried to divide `mccabe` by 2:

```{r, error=TRUE}
mccabe / 2
```

A big part of learning to use R will be learning how to troubleshoot and detect typos in your code that generate error messages.

## Assignment 1 

Below is an exercise that will demonstrate you are able to use R as a calculator and create R scripts, as well as locate important course platforms.

We will walk through this assignment together during class, but you are welcome to try to do this ahead of time on your own. You will submit, on Canvas, two documents prior to the deadline.

  - An R script (.R) file with your code. Follow the best practices by titling your script and using \# comments to explain your steps. This code should be clean. I should be able to run your code to verify that the code produces the answers you write down.
  - A Word document / Google Docs document or pdf with answers to the written questions (Problems 3-6 below). This document should also have a title with your name on it.
      + You may also alternatively submit a compiled RMarkdown document. We will discuss what RMarkdown is during class.

***Assignment Exercises***

  1. Create an R script saved as ``LastnameSetup1.R" (use your last name). Within the R script, follow the example from  this handout and title the script.
  2. Set your working directory, and include the file pathway (within `setwd()`) at the top of your .R script.
  3. Do the calculation 8 + 3 - 2 in R. Store it as an object with an informative name. Report the answer.
  4. Do the calculation 5 x 3 in R. Store it as an object with an informative name. Report the answer.
  5. Add these two calculations together. Note: do this by adding together the objects you created, not the underlying raw calculations. Report the answer.
  6.  Write down how you will complete your R assignments this semester. For example, if you have a personal laptop with R and RStudio on it, you will simply write "I will use my personal laptop." If you don't have a personal computer or laptop, please indicate where on campus or off-campus you will have regular access to a computer with R/RStudio to do your work. It is essential that you have regular access to a computer so that you will not fall behind in this course.
  7. Navigate to the course Piazza site and post a message. This can be as simple as "hello" or a reply to another person's post. (No need to report this in your submission.)

## R Markdown

An R Markdown document, which you can create in RStudio, allows you to weave together regular text, R code, and the output of R code in the same document. This can be very convenient when conducting data analysis because it allows you more space to explain what you are doing in each step. It can also be an effective platform for writing a report on a data analysis, similar to what you do when you write up a problem set.

***Note: RMarkdown is not required for this course. It is up to you if you would like to write your problem sets in RMarkdown***

R Markdown documents can be "compiled" into html, pdf, or docx documents. Below is an example of what a compiled html file looks like.

  - Note that the image has both written text and a gray chunk, within which there is some R code, as well as the output of the R code (e.g., the number 8 and the image of the histogram plot)

<center> ![](images/rmarkdownscreenshot.png){width=60%}</center>

We say this is a "compiled" RMarkdown document because it differs from the raw version of the file, which is a .Rmd file format. Below is an example of what the raw .Rmd version looks like, compared to the compiled html version.

![](images/rmarkdownraw.png){width=45%} ![](images/rmarkdownscreenshot.png){width=40%}


### How to get setup in RMarkdown

Just like with a regular R script, to work in RMarkdown, you will open up RStudio.

The **first time** you will be working in RMarkdown, you will want to install two packages: `rmarkdown` and `knitr`. You can do this in the Console window in RStudio.

Type the following into the Console window and hit enter/return.

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
install.packages("knitr")
```

Once you have those installed, now, each time you want to create an RMarkdown document, you will open up a .Rmd R Markdown file and get to work.

  1. Go to File -> New File -> R Markdown in RStudio
      - Alternatively, you can click the green + symbol at the top left of your RStudio window
  2. This should open up a window with several options, similar to the image below
      - Create an informative title and change the author name to match your own
      - For now, we will keep the file type as html. In the future, you can create pdf or .doc documents. However, these require additional programs installed on your computer.

![](images/rmarkdownnewfile.png)


  3. After you hit "OK" a new .Rmd script file will open in your top-left window with some template language and code chunks, similar to the image below. 
  
![](images/rmarkdowntemplate.png)
  
  4. ***Save as .Rmd file.*** Save the file by going to "File -> Save as" in RStudio
      - Give the file an informative name like your LastnamePractice1.Rmd
  5. ***Key Components.*** Now you are ready to work within the Rmd script file. We will point to four basic components of this file, and you can build your knowledge of RMarkdown from there.
      1. The top part bracketed by `---` on top and bottom is the YAML component. This tells RStudio the pertinent information about how to "compile" the Rmd file. Most of the time you can leave this alone, but you can always edit the title, author, or date as you wish.
      2. The next component are the global options for the document. It is conveniently labeled "setup." By default what this is saying is that the compiled version will "echo" (i.e., display all code chunks and output) unless you specifically specify otherwise. For example, note that it says `include = FALSE` for the setup chunk. That setting means that this code chunk will "run" but it will not appear in the nicely compiled .html file. Most of the time you will not need to edit those settings.
      3. The third component I want to bring attention to is the body text. The \# symbol in RMarkdown is used to indicate that you have a new section of the document. For example, in the compiled images at the beginning, this resulted in the text being larger and bolded when it said "Problem 2." In addition to just using a single \#, using \#\# or \#\#\# can indicate subsections or subsubsections. Other than that symbol, you can generally write text just as you would in any word processing program, with some exceptions, such as how to make text bold or italicized. (See bottom of section for resources on the Markdown language.)
      4. The final component I want to call attention to are the other main body code chunks. These are specific parts of the document where you want to create a mini R script. To create these, you can simply click the + C symbol toward the top of the top left window of RStudio and indicate you want an R chunk.
      
      <center>
![](images/rmarkdownnewchunk.png){width=20%}</center>
        - For example, in the image above, there is an R code chunk labeled `cars`. The `cars` component is just a label for the code chunk. Labeling code chunks is not necessary. By default, a new R code chunk will just have `r` in the brackets, and that is sufficient.
    
  6. ***Writing R Code.*** Within a code chunk, you can type R code just like you would in any R script. To run ("execute") the R code, you can run a single line the exact same way you do in a regular R script by moving the cursor to the end of a line of code or highlighting a portion of code and hitting "Run." However, in RMarkdown, you also have the option of running an entire code chunk at once by hitting the green triangle at the top-right of a given code chunk.
    
![](images/codechunkexample.png){width=70%}

  7. ***Knitting the document.*** Once you have added a code chunk and/or some text, you are ready to compile or "Knit" the document. This is what generates the .html document.
      - To do so, click on the Knit button toward the top of the top-left window of Rstudio. After a few moments, this should open up a preview window displaying the compiled html file. 
      - It will also save an actual .html file in your working directory (the same location on your computer where you have saved the .Rmd file)
      - Try to locate this compiled .html file on your computer and open it. For most computers, .html files will open in your default web browser, such as Google Chrome or Safari. 
      - This step is a common place where errors are detected and generated. Sometimes the compiling process fails due to errors in the R code in your code chunks or an error in the Markdown syntax. If your document fails to knit, the next step is to try to troubleshoot the error messages the compiling process generates. The best way to reduce and more easily detect errors is to "knit as you go." Try to knit your document after each chunk of code you create. 

### Additional RMarkdown resources

Here are a few additional resources for working with RMarkdown.

  - This [website](https://monashbioinformaticsplatform.github.io/2017-11-16-open-science-training/topics/rmarkdown.html) provides some basic syntax for the Markdown language, such as how to display bulleted lists and how to bold or italicize text.
  - This [page](https://rpubs.com/brandonkopp/RMarkdown) walks through the setup of RMarkdown documents similar to what the course notes just did. This provides a second set of instructions and additional examples of settings you can use to customize your RMarkdown output (e.g., how large figures are when they are displayed).
  - This [page](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html) talks more about compiling aka rendering aka knitting Rmd documents into different formats, such as html, pdf, or Word doc files.
  

See the course Canvas page for additional templates for working with RMarkdown in problem sets.


## Wait a second why R?

R is a free and open-source program.

  - This means anyone can use R. In the future, if you are not at a university that provides licenses for software or at an organization that can afford to buy very expensive softwares (e.g., SPSS, Stata), you can still use R!!
  - This means anyone can access the underlying code to understand how different functions and capabilities work.
  
R has a very large community of users and developers.

  - People are constantly expanding R's capabilities. This means that as the tools and methods change, R will also adapt very quickly to expand with new capabilities.
  - Google will be your friend. Multiple websites are devoted to helping people troubleshoot R problems and providing tutorials for using R.
  

R is very versatile

  - R can 
      + Manage multiple datasets at once, subset, append, and merge data 
      + Be used for descriptive analyses, as well more complicated statistical methods, 
      + Employ APIs to communicate with external databases,
      + Map data, 
      + Conduct text analyses,
      + And create interactive visualizations, among other capabilities.
  - With RStudio, users can also directly integrate their R code and written text to automatically generate data reports, presentations, interactive dashboards, and more.
  - R also has a reputation of having terrific visualization tools, again with a lot of flexibility
  
  
R facilitates reproducibility

  - (While some other softwares also provide this ability), R encourages the use of scripts, which help researchers keep track of every modification they have made to data and every analysis they have run. This helps future researchers replicate, verify, and build on previous research.
      + Imagine if you accidentally enter the wrong number in a spreadsheet cell in Excel/google sheets. You may have no record you ever did that. In R, you can track all of the modifications you make so that months later you can review your steps to check them for accuracy.
  

R is popular

  - While there is no guarantee R will remain popular forever, it is commonly employed in many different industries and organizations. Learning R can be a useful skill when applying for jobs. Moreover, even if jobs don't require R, in learning R, it will be easier to learn how to use other statistical programs and languages, such as SPSS, Stata, or Python, as well as visualization tools like Tableau, or database tools like SQL.
  
R has some distinct advantages compared to other programs, but all programs have benefits and weaknesses

  - Here are a couple of articles comparing R to Excel [here](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/r-vs-excel/) and [here](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2014/10/why-r-is-better-than-excel.html)
  - Here is an article making a case for R over multiple other programs from [R Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2019/07/whats-the-best-statistical-software-a-comparison-of-r-python-sas-spss-and-stata/)

Rgghhhh

  - With all this, R does come with a learning curve. It is a programming language. In other softwares, such as Stata or SPSS, there are more "point and click" capabilities.
  - Especially as you first work with R, you may find it is easier to do some tasks outside of R, such as with Excel or another spreadsheet software. That's fine. Ultimately, in political science, R is one tool we can use to pursue research goals. There are many other tools, and you may find each has their own strengths and weaknesses.
  - For this class, R provides a one-stop-shop for the wide range of types of data wrangling and analyses used across data science.
