This section will discuss the goal of description in social science.


## Description in Political Science

What are things we want to describe in political science?

  - Unemployment rate, GDP
  - Voter turnout, vote share for a party in an election 
  - Percentage of women in the labor force
  - Poverty rates over time

What else? What does description help us achieve?

What does description help us achieve?

  - Identify tendencies
  - Identify patterns or trends
  - Identify relationships between two or more factors
  - Help us generalize from anecdotes, what is common vs. what is uncommon?
  - Diagnose demand, needs, potential problems, likely outcomes 
  
Generate ideas for other goals, such as explanation and prediction

## Process of Describing

How do we go about a descriptive quantitative analysis?
  
  1. Substantive Expertise: Start with a topic, puzzle, or question (e.g., How is the economy doing?)
  2. Find outcome data relevant to that question (e.g., GDP)
  3. Find multiple relevant units or "data points"
      - Multiple years of data (e.g., U.S., from 1900 to 2020) 
      - Multiple countries from one year (e.g., U.S. to Germany to other
countries)
  4. Summarize the data to help answer the question (more on this later)
  
### Example Process

  1. How is the economy doing?
  2. Find outcome data relevant to that question 
      - Let's ask people.
  3. Find multiple relevant units or data points
      - We will ask several people. Each person will be a data point.
  4. Summarize the data
